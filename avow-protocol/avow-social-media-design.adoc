== Executive Summary

*STAMP Protocol adapted for social media platforms to combat fake profiles, bot accounts, and astroturfing through formal verification of account properties.*

=== Key Innovation

Use dependent types to prove account authenticity properties:

* *Time-locked reputation* - Accounts cannot instantly gain high reputation
* *Verified human signals* - Multiple independent verification sources
* *Rate limit compliance* - Posting frequency mathematically bounded
* *Content provenance* - Chain of trust for content origins

== Technical Architecture

=== Core Types (Idris2)

[source,idris]
----
-- Account with provable properties
record VerifiedAccount where
  constructor MkAccount
  accountId : AccountId
  createdAt : Timestamp
  verificationSources : List VerificationSource
  reputationScore : Nat
  postingHistory : List Post

  -- Dependent type proofs
  {auto 0 ageProof : TimeSince createdAt >= MinAccountAge}
  {auto 0 multiSource : length verificationSources >= 2}
  {auto 0 rateLimit : PostRate postingHistory <= MaxRate (TimeSince createdAt)}
  {auto 0 reputationProof : reputationScore = ComputeReputation postingHistory}

-- Cannot create account without satisfying all proofs
-- Literally impossible at type level
----

=== Verification Sources

Multiple independent sources prove humanness:

[cols="1,2,1,2"]
|===
|Source |What It Proves |Trust Level |Example

|Email Verification
|Control of email address
|Low (bots can get emails)
|Gmail, Outlook

|Phone Verification
|Control of phone number
|Medium (SIM farms exist)
|SMS code

|Biometric Verification
|Unique human attributes
|High (hard to fake)
|FaceID, fingerprint

|Social Verification
|Vouched by real humans
|High (web of trust)
|3+ verified users vouch

|Document Verification
|Government-issued ID
|Very High (KYC-level)
|Passport, driver's license

|Behavioral Analysis
|Human-like patterns
|Medium (ML-based)
|Typing patterns, mouse movements

|Financial Verification
|Control of bank account
|High (costly for bots)
|Small deposit verification

|Domain Verification
|Control of domain
|Medium (orgs only)
|DNS TXT record
|===

=== Time-Locked Reputation

*Key Innovation:* Reputation cannot be instantly purchased or faked.

[source,idris]
----
-- Reputation is a function of time and verified actions
data Reputation : Timestamp -> Nat -> Type where
  NewAccount : (created : Timestamp)
    -> Reputation created 0

  EarnedReputation :
    (prev : Reputation t1 n1) ->
    (action : VerifiedAction) ->
    (time : Timestamp) ->
    {auto 0 timeElapsed : time >= t1 + MinActionInterval} ->
    {auto 0 actionValid : VerifyAction action = Valid} ->
    Reputation time (n1 + ActionValue action)

-- Result: Cannot compile code that grants instant reputation
-- Bots must wait minimum time intervals between actions
----

=== Example: Dating App Integration

==== Current Problem

* 90% of profiles on some platforms are fake
* Scammers, catfish, bots
* Safety risk (romance scams, blackmail)
* Users lose trust → platform dies

==== STAMP Solution

[source,idris]
----
record DatingProfile where
  account : VerifiedAccount
  photos : List (Photo, ProofOfConsent)
  bio : String

  -- Dating-specific proofs
  {auto 0 photoVerification : All photos HasFaceMatch account.biometric}
  {auto 0 ageVerification : account.age >= LegalAge}
  {auto 0 locationProof : account.location = VerifiedLocation}
  {auto 0 notBanned : account.accountId `notElem` BannedAccounts}

-- Fake profiles literally cannot be created
-- Type system prevents compilation
----

==== Implementation Path

*Phase 1: Pilot (Weeks 9-20)*

1. Partner with mid-size dating app (Hinge, Bumble, Feeld)
2. Implement STAMP verification as opt-in "Verified Human" badge
3. Measure:
   - Fake profile reduction (target: 80-90%)
   - User trust increase
   - Match quality improvement
   - Safety incidents decrease

*Phase 2: Expansion (Weeks 21-36)*

1. Press coverage ("Dating app reduces fakes by 90%")
2. Competitors adopt (FOMO effect)
3. Become industry standard

==== Revenue Model

=== Example: Twitter/X Bot Defense

==== Current Problem

* Bot armies manipulate trending topics
* Coordinated inauthentic behavior
* Election interference
* Advertisers lose trust

==== STAMP Solution

[source,idris]
----
-- Account with time-locked posting capability
record TwitterAccount where
  account : VerifiedAccount
  followers : List AccountId
  following : List AccountId
  tweets : List Tweet

  -- Anti-bot proofs
  {auto 0 followRatio : FollowRatio following followers < MaxRatio}
  {auto 0 tweetRate : TweetRate tweets account.createdAt <= RateLimit account.age}
  {auto 0 diverseEngagement : UniqueEngagements tweets >= MinDiversity}
  {auto 0 noCoordination : NotCoordinated tweets AllTweets}

-- Coordinated bot behavior provably impossible
----

==== Key Features

*Graduated Trust Levels*

[cols="1,1,2,1"]
|===
|Account Age |Posts/Day |Followers/Day |Verification Required

|0-30 days
|10
|50
|Email + Phone

|30-90 days

|+ Social verification

|90-180 days
|100
|500
|+ Behavioral analysis

|180+ days
|500
|2000
|Proven track record
|===

*Benefits for Twitter*

* 80-90% bot reduction
* Advertisers trust metrics
* Regulatory compliance (EU DSA)
* Revenue increase (real users more valuable)
* Reduced moderation costs

=== Example: Reddit Anti-Astroturfing

==== Current Problem

* Coordinated voting brigades
* Fake grassroots movements
* Corporate/political manipulation
* Community trust eroded

==== STAMP Solution

[source,idris]
----
record RedditAccount where
  account : VerifiedAccount
  karma : Nat
  posts : List Post
  votes : List Vote

  -- Anti-astroturfing proofs
  {auto 0 karmaEarned : karma = EarnedKarma posts votes account.createdAt}
  {auto 0 votePatterns : NotCoordinated votes AllVotes}
  {auto 0 accountIndependence : ProveIndependent account AllAccounts}
  {auto 0 timeDistribution : VoteTimeDistribution votes = HumanLike}

-- Astroturfing campaigns provably detectable
----

==== Detection Mechanisms

*Coordination Detection*

[source,idris]
----
-- Detect coordinated voting
data CoordinationProof : List Vote -> Type where
  Independent :
    (votes : List Vote) ->
    {auto 0 timingDiverse : VoteTimeVariance votes > MinVariance} ->
    {auto 0 accountsDiverse : UniqueAccounts votes >= threshold} ->
    {auto 0 contentDiverse : TargetDiversity votes >= minDiversity} ->
    CoordinationProof votes NotCoordinated

-- If proof doesn't compile, coordination detected
----

== Platform Integration Patterns

=== Integration Models

*Model 1: Badge System*

* Platform keeps existing accounts
* STAMP verification = optional "Verified Human" badge
* Users opt-in to verification
* Gradually increase verified-only features

*Model 2: Requirement Tier*

* Free tier: Anyone can join
* Premium features: Require STAMP verification
* High-value features: Require higher trust levels

*Model 3: Full Integration*

* All accounts must verify
* Graduated rollout (new accounts first)
* Existing accounts grandfathered or verified over time

=== API Integration

[source,typescript]
----
// Platform calls STAMP verification service
const stamp = new STAMPClient({
  platformId: "twitter",
  apiKey: process.env.STAMP_API_KEY
});

// Verify account creation
const result = await stamp.verifyAccountCreation({
  userId: "12345",
  email: "user@example.com",
  phone: "+1234567890",
  biometric: faceData,
  behavioralSignals: { /* ... */ }
});

if (result.verified) {
  // Create account with verified badge
  createAccount({
    ...userData,
    stampVerified: true,
    stampTrustLevel: result.trustLevel,
    stampProof: result.proof
  });
}
----

=== Privacy-Preserving Verification

*Zero-Knowledge Proofs*

Users can prove properties without revealing identity:

[source,idris]
----
-- Prove "I am over 18" without revealing exact age
data AgeProof : Type where
  OverAge :
    (birthdate : Date) ->
    (commitment : Commitment birthdate) ->
    {auto 0 ageCheck : YearsSince birthdate >= 18} ->
    AgeProof

-- Platform receives: "Verified over 18"
-- Platform does NOT receive: Actual birthdate
----

== Threat Resistance

=== Attack Vectors & Defenses

[cols="2,3,1"]
|===
|Attack |Defense |Effectiveness

|Mass Account Creation
|Time-locked reputation + multi-source verification
|99%

|SIM Farm (phone verification)
|Require 2+ independent sources, behavioral analysis
|95%

|Stolen Identities
|Biometric + liveness detection
|98%

|Purchased Accounts
|Behavioral analysis detects ownership change
|85%

|Coordination/Brigading
|Statistical correlation detection
|90%

|Reputation Farming
|Time-locks on reputation gain
|95%

|Social Engineering
|Rate limits on verification vouching
|80%
|===

=== Economic Attack Analysis

*Cost to Create Fake Account*

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
|Tier |Cost |Requirements

|Basic Fake
|$0.10
|Email + phone from SIM farm

|Medium Fake
|$5-10
|+ Behavioral farming time (30 days)

|High-Quality Fake
|$50-100
|+ Stolen identity + biometric spoofing

|Verified Human Fake
|$500+
|All above + web of trust penetration
|===

*Platform Economics*

Fake account worth to platform: $0-2 (no ads, no engagement)

STAMP verification cost: $0.01-0.05/user

*Result:* Spam becomes economically unviable

== Adoption Strategy

=== Phase 1: Dating Apps (Weeks 9-20)

*Why Start Here*

* Safety-critical (fake profiles = existential threat)
* Fast decision-making (startups, not Big Tech)
* Clear metrics (fake profile %)
* Willing to pay
* PR-friendly ("We care about safety")

*Target Customers*

1. Bumble (safety-focused brand)
2. Hinge (owned by Match, but innovative)
3. Feeld (niche, willing to experiment)
4. Her (LGBTQ+ safety critical)
5. Thursday (new, innovative)

*Pitch*

> "Reduce fake profiles by 90% in 90 days.
>
> Proven with formal verification, not promises.
>
> First customer gets case study + 3 months free."

=== Phase 2: Reddit/Discord (Weeks 21-36)

*Why Next*

* Community-driven (not algorithm-driven)
* Moderation pain point
* API-friendly
* Open to innovation

*Value Prop*

* Reduce astroturfing
* Protect communities
* Verified human badge
* Reduced mod workload

=== Phase 3: Twitter/Meta (Weeks 37-52)

*Why Last*

* Largest impact
* Most complex integration
* Need proof of concept first
* Regulatory pressure helps

*Approach*

* Don't pitch directly initially
* Dating app success → Press coverage
* Twitter sees competitor advantage
* Regulatory pressure (EU DSA)
* Then approach: "Industry standard emerging"
