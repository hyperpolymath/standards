==== Formal Verification

[source,idris]
----
-- Impossible to construct verified account without proofs
-- This is guaranteed by Idris2 type system
data VerifiedAccount : Type where
  MkVerified :
    (id : AccountId) ->
    (sources : List VerificationSource) ->
    {auto 0 multiSource : length sources >= 2} ->
    {auto 0 sourcesValid : All VerifySource sources} ->
    {auto 0 sourcesIndependent : Independent sources} ->
    VerifiedAccount

-- Bug: Verification bypass
-- Cannot happen: Type system prevents compilation
----

==== Why Formal Verification Matters

*Traditional Code (Rust/Go):*

[source,rust]
----
struct VerifiedAccount {
    sources: Vec<VerificationSource>,
    is_verified: bool, // ❌ Can be set to true without checking sources!
}

// Bug possible:
let fake = VerifiedAccount {
    sources: vec![],
    is_verified: true, // ← Oops, verified with no sources
};
----

*STAMP (Idris2):*

[source,idris]
----
-- Literally impossible to compile:
badAccount : VerifiedAccount
badAccount = MkVerified someId []
-- Error: Cannot satisfy proof: length [] >= 2
-- Code won't even compile!
----

==== Residual Risk

*Attack Still Possible If:*

* Bug in Idris2 compiler itself (extremely rare)
* Bug in FFI layer (Zig implementation)
* Misuse of STAMP library by platform

*Risk Level:* VERY LOW

* *Likelihood:* Very Low (formal verification is highly reliable)
* *Impact:* High if exploited
* *Detection Time:* Variable
* *Recovery:* Patch, re-verify affected accounts

=== AV-7: Supply Chain Attacks
