= STAMP Protocol v1.0.4 (Summary)
:toc:

== Summary

This release consolidates the v1.x cleanup and protocol-first reset:

* Renamed and aligned the repo as `stamp-protocol`.
* Reframed the site to match the protocol draft (no overclaims).
* Added a protocol draft + spec outline.
* Switched demo checks to deterministic, build-time proof data.
* Added consent proof vectors and source labeling in the demo.
* Cleaned Deno config and build warnings.

== Highlights

* `docs/PROTOCOL.md` - Expanded protocol draft.
* `docs/PROTOCOL-OUTLINE.md` - Spec structure for full v1.
* `scripts/generate_proof.ts` - Build-time proof data generator.
* `public/proof-data.json` - Deterministic proof vectors.
* `public/demo.js` - Demo now shows proof source (build-time vs runtime).

== Notes

This is a demo-first site with protocol-first messaging. Full cryptographic
proofs remain in draft and are tracked in the protocol docs.
