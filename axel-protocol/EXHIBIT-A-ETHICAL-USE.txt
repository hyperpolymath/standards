EXHIBIT A - ETHICAL USE GUIDELINES
================================================================================

Supplement to Palimpsest-MPL License v1.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These guidelines establish ethical expectations for use of Covered Software.
While legal enforcement focuses on specific obligations, these principles
address broader concerns about respect, attribution, and cultural sensitivity
that law alone cannot capture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORE PRINCIPLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. RESPECT FOR EMOTIONAL LINEAGE

   Creative works carry meaning beyond their literal content. Protest songs,
   cultural narratives, trauma stories, and community expressions have
   emotional weight and historical context that deserve recognition.

   When using Covered Software:
   - Acknowledge the cultural and historical context where documented
   - Avoid uses that trivialize, mock, or misappropriate such content
   - Consider how your use affects communities connected to the work

2. TRANSPARENT ATTRIBUTION

   Attribution is more than legal compliance; it is recognition of creative
   labor and intellectual contribution.

   Best practices:
   - Provide meaningful attribution, not just license text
   - Link to original sources where possible
   - Acknowledge the lineage of ideas, not just code

3. AI AND AUTOMATED SYSTEMS

   Automated systems, particularly AI/ML training, present unique challenges
   for creative attribution and meaning preservation.

   When using Covered Software with AI systems:
   - Document all training uses in your model cards or system documentation
   - Do not claim AI outputs inherit the creative authority of training data
   - Consider opt-out mechanisms for creators who object to AI training use
   - Preserve provenance information through your processing pipelines

4. COMMERCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

   Commercial entities have greater resources and therefore greater
   responsibility to uphold ethical use.

   Commercial users should:
   - Conduct due diligence on the provenance and licensing of works used
   - Implement systems to preserve and communicate attribution
   - Support the communities whose creative works enable your products
   - Consider contributing back to projects you depend upon

5. CULTURAL SENSITIVITY

   Works may have significance to specific communities, including:
   - Indigenous and diaspora narratives
   - Marginalized community expressions
   - Religious and spiritual content
   - Historical trauma documentation

   Exercise care when:
   - Adapting works from cultural contexts you do not share
   - Creating derivative works that might alter cultural meaning
   - Distributing works in contexts the original creators might not have
     anticipated or approved

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPERS

- Read and consider the Emotional Lineage documentation if present
- Include meaningful CONTRIBUTORS or AUTHORS files in your projects
- When in doubt about appropriate use, contact the original creators

FOR ORGANIZATIONS

- Establish clear policies for open source and creative commons use
- Train staff on attribution and ethical use requirements
- Implement technical systems to preserve provenance metadata
- Conduct periodic audits of compliance

FOR AI/ML PRACTITIONERS

- Maintain detailed records of training data provenance
- Implement filtering for works with explicit opt-out declarations
- Document model lineage and training data sources publicly
- Consider creating opt-out mechanisms and respecting them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These guidelines are enforced primarily through community norms rather than
litigation. The Palimpsest Stewardship Council may:

- Issue public statements about violations of ethical use principles
- Maintain lists of known bad actors for community awareness
- Provide guidance to creators on responding to misuse
- Recommend creators pursue legal remedies for serious violations

We believe that reputation and community standing are powerful incentives
for ethical behavior, and that litigation should be a last resort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EVOLUTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These guidelines will evolve as technology and community understanding
develop. The Palimpsest Stewardship Council welcomes input from:

- Creators and artists
- Indigenous and marginalized communities
- AI/ML researchers and practitioners
- Legal scholars and practitioners
- Open source community members

Submit feedback via the project repository Issues.
