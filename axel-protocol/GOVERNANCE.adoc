:icons: font

*ASPEC* (*A*XEL *S*tandards and *P*rotocol *E*nforcement *C*onsortium) is the neutral, multi-stakeholder organization that maintains the AXEL protocol specification and reference implementations.

== Mission

ASPEC exists to:

1. *Maintain AXEL*: Ensure the protocol evolves to meet regulatory, technical, and privacy needs
2. *Neutral governance*: No single vendor or stakeholder controls the protocol
3. *Diverse representation*: Include CDNs, privacy advocates, academics, platforms, and security experts
4. *Long-term sustainability*: Protocol survives beyond individual contributors
5. *Transparent operation*: All decisions documented publicly (GitHub, mailing lists)

== Governance Bodies

=== 1. Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

*Role*: Technical decisions (spec changes, security reviews, reference implementations)

*Size*: 5-7 members

*Composition*:

* 2 CDN/infrastructure representatives (e.g., Cloudflare, Fastly)
* 2 privacy advocates (e.g., EFF, Open Rights Group)
* 1 academic researcher
* 1 platform representative (ethical adult content platform)
* 1 security expert (e.g., OpenSSF, OWASP)

*Term*: 2 years, staggered (half the committee rotates each year)

*Decision-making*:

* Consensus preferred (all members agree)
* If consensus fails: 2/3 majority vote
* Quorum: 4 members

*Responsibilities*:

* Review and approve spec changes
* Maintain reference implementations
* Security vulnerability response
* Roadmap prioritization

=== 2. Governing Board (Future)

*Note*: This body only exists if ASPEC formalizes (e.g., joins Linux Foundation or forms 501(c)(3)).

*Role*: Budget, fundraising, legal, member recruitment

*Size*: 3-5 members

*Composition*:

* 1 TSC representative
* 2 paying member organization representatives
* 1 independent (nonprofit executive or academic)

*Term*: 1 year

*Decision-making*: Simple majority

=== 3. Working Groups (WGs)

*Purpose*: Focus areas for specific technical or policy issues

*Formation*: Anyone can propose; TSC approves

*Examples*:

* *Privacy WG*: DoQ, OHTTP, attestation design

== Decision-Making Process

=== Consensus

*Preferred method*: All TSC members agree (no objections)

*Process*:

1. Proposal submitted (GitHub Issue or PR)
2. 7-day comment period
3. TSC discusses on private mailing list
4. If no objections after 7 days: approved

=== Voting (Fallback)

If consensus fails:

1. TSC chair calls for vote

3. *Threshold*: 2/3 majority (e.g., 5 of 7 members)
4. *Quorum*: 4 members must vote
5. Result published publicly (GitHub, mailing list)

=== Emergency Changes

*Security vulnerabilities* can be approved without 7-day waiting period:

1. Security researcher reports issue (security@axel-protocol.org)
2. TSC discusses privately
3. If confirmed: patch developed immediately
4. Fix deployed, then disclosed publicly (responsible disclosure)

== Conflict Resolution

=== Disputes Within TSC

1. *Mediation*: TSC chair mediates (or appoints neutral mediator)
2. *Escalation*: If unresolved, Governing Board arbitrates (when formalized)
3. *Last resort*: Member may withdraw (but cannot fork with "AXEL" trademark)

Process:

1. Report to conduct@axel-protocol.org
2. Incident response team investigates (3 neutral members)
3. Sanctions: warning, temporary ban, permanent ban
4. Appeals: Governing Board reviews (when formalized)

== Transparency

All ASPEC activities are public except:

* *Security vulnerabilities*: Disclosed privately until patched

3. Final vote (incorporates feedback)

*Major changes* (e.g., adding/removing governance bodies) require:

* TSC unanimous approval OR
* Governing Board approval (when formalized)

== Initial Bootstrap

*Phase 1 (Current)*: Informal consortium

* Founder (Jonathan Jewell) acts as interim TSC chair
