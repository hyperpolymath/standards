= ASPEC Charter
:toc: left
:toclevels: 3
:icons: font

== Preamble

The *AXEL Standards and Protocol Enforcement Consortium* (ASPEC) is a neutral, multi-stakeholder organization formed to maintain the AXEL protocol—a technical standard for labeling and filtering sexually explicit content in a privacy-preserving, jurisdiction-aware manner.

This Charter defines ASPEC's mission, scope, principles, and governance framework.

== Mission Statement

ASPEC exists to:

[quote]
____
Develop and maintain open, privacy-preserving technical standards for labeling sexually explicit content, enabling precise network filtering while respecting jurisdictional diversity and user autonomy.
____

== Core Principles

=== 1. Privacy-First Design

* *DoQ/OHTTP*: Prevent ISP logging of user access
* *Short-lived tokens*: Minimize tracking (15-minute max validity)
* *Zero-knowledge proofs*: Verify age without revealing exact birthdate
* *No centralized identity*: Users attest locally, not via global database

=== 2. Jurisdiction-Neutral

* *Content labeled universally*: AXEL-STS declares "this is sexually explicit"
* *Enforcement local*: Networks decide policy (18+ in UK, 21+ in Singapore, blanket block in Iran)
* *No moral judgments*: AXEL is content-type agnostic, not content-value prescriptive

=== 3. Opt-In, Not Censorship

* *Voluntary adoption*: Platforms choose to use AXEL (like HTTPS, not mandate)
* *User control*: Networks decide filtering policy (schools block, homes allow)
* *No backdoors*: AXEL doesn't enable surveillance or warrantless access

=== 4. Technical Excellence

* *Formal verification*: ReScript + Idris2 for provably correct implementations
* *Security-first*: DNSSEC, RPKI, IPsec, quantum-safe signatures
* *Performance*: IPv6 QoS, CDN optimization, minimal latency
* *Interoperability*: Works with existing infrastructure (Cloudflare, firewalld, etc.)

=== 5. Transparent Governance

* *Open development*: Specs on GitHub, public mailing lists
* *Inclusive participation*: Anyone can contribute (no membership required for code/docs)
* *Documented decisions*: All TSC votes public
* *Neutral IP policy*: Royalty-free patents, open-source code

== Scope

=== In Scope

ASPEC maintains standards for:

* *AXEL-STS*: DNS-based content labeling (TXT records)
* *APL*: Authorized prefix lists for IP whitelisting
* *Attestation*: Age verification tokens (JWT, ZKP)
* *Privacy protocols*: DoQ, OHTTP integration
* *Reference implementations*: Validators, servers, clients
* *Compliance guidelines*: UK OSA, EU DSA, jurisdiction-specific rules

=== Out of Scope

ASPEC does NOT:

* *Regulate content*: We label, not judge (no "acceptable use" policies)
* *Operate platforms*: We write specs, not run services
* *Lobby for laws*: We provide technical tools for compliance, not advocate for specific legislation
* *Develop gambling/pharma protocols*: AXEL is for sexually explicit content only (other use cases need separate protocols)

== Stakeholder Roles

ASPEC includes diverse stakeholders with different interests:

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| Stakeholder | Interest | Contribution

| CDNs (Cloudflare, Fastly)
| Bandwidth optimization, compliance automation
| IPv6 infrastructure, edge computing

| Privacy advocates (EFF, ORG)
| Protect user anonymity, prevent overreach
| Privacy audits, DoQ/OHTTP design

| Academic researchers
| Study harm reduction, protocol effectiveness
| Formal verification, pilots, publications

| Adult platforms
| Legal safe harbor, payment processor acceptance
| Real-world testing, feedback

| Security experts (OpenSSF, OWASP)
| Prevent abuse, vulnerability response
| Penetration testing, threat modeling

| Network operators (ISPs, schools)
| Precise filtering, low operational cost
| Deployment feedback, firewall rules
|===

== Non-Goals

ASPEC explicitly does NOT aim to:

1. *Eliminate explicit content*: We enable filtering, not eradication
2. *Mandate age verification*: AXEL is opt-in; platforms/networks choose adoption
3. *Solve non-consensual sharing*: Revenge porn requires content provenance (C2PA), not network protocols
4. *Replace existing standards*: AXEL complements HTTPS, MTA-STS, DANE (doesn't replace)
5. *Conflate use cases*: Medical education, artistic content, gambling, alcohol are OUT of scope

== Governance Structure

See link:GOVERNANCE.adoc[GOVERNANCE.adoc] for details.

*Summary*:

* *Technical Steering Committee (TSC)*: 5-7 members, technical decisions, 2-year terms
* *Governing Board*: 3-5 members, budget/strategy (when formalized)
* *Working Groups*: Open participation, focus areas (privacy, compliance, implementation)

== Membership

ASPEC welcomes members from:

* *CDNs and infrastructure providers*
* *Privacy organizations and advocacy groups*
* *Academic institutions and researchers*
* *Adult content platforms* (ethical, legal)
* *Security firms and consultancies*
* *ISPs and network operators*

*Anti-discrimination*: ASPEC does not discriminate based on:

* Organization type (commercial, nonprofit, government)
* Size (Fortune 500 or solo developer)
* Geography (global participation)
* Content viewpoint (we're content-type agnostic, not content-value prescriptive)

== Intellectual Property

=== Patents

All members grant *irrevocable, royalty-free licenses* for AXEL implementations.

* *Defensive termination*: Patent trolling forfeits your license
* *Prior art protection*: Members cannot claim ownership of pre-existing techniques (DNS, IPv6, etc.)

=== Copyright

* *Specifications*: CC BY 4.0 (Attribution)
* *Code*: PMPL-1.0 (Palimpsest-MPL, file-level copyleft)
* *Documentation*: CC BY 4.0

=== Trademark

* *"AXEL"*, *"AXEL Protocol"*, *"ASPEC"* owned by ASPEC (or fiscal host)
* *Use*: Members can claim compliance ("supports AXEL"), non-members need permission
* *Enforcement*: Prevents misleading forks or commercial hijacking

== Ethical Guidelines

ASPEC operates under the Palimpsest-MPL license, which includes ethical use requirements (see link:EXHIBIT-A-ETHICAL-USE.txt[EXHIBIT-A-ETHICAL-USE.txt]).

*Key principles*:

1. *Emotional lineage preservation*: Maintain context and attribution
2. *Non-interpretive system notice*: Document AI training use (don't claim AI outputs carry original intent)
3. *Good faith*: Commercial users act ethically, not just legally

*Violations*: TSC may revoke membership for willful ethical breaches (e.g., using AXEL to enable child exploitation)

== Amendment and Dissolution

=== Amendment

This Charter can be amended by:

1. TSC unanimous approval OR
2. Governing Board majority vote (when formalized)
3. 30-day public comment period
4. Final ratification

=== Dissolution

If ASPEC dissolves:

1. All specifications become CC0 (public domain)
2. All code remains PMPL-1.0 (file-level copyleft)
3. Trademarks transferred to Linux Foundation or similar neutral steward
4. Assets (if any) donated to a privacy-focused nonprofit (e.g., EFF)

== Ratification
