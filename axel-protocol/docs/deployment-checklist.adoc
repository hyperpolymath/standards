:icons: font

Complete guide for deploying axel-protocol.org from start to finish.

== Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

=== Domain (COMPLETED ✓)
* [x] Register axel-protocol.org at Cloudflare
* [ ] Configure DNS to point to GitHub Pages
* [ ] Verify DNS propagation

=== GitHub Pages
* [ ] Enable Pages in repo settings
* [ ] Set custom domain to axel-protocol.org
* [ ] Wait for SSL certificate provisioning
* [ ] Enable "Enforce HTTPS"

=== Email Forwarding
* [ ] Set up Cloudflare Email Routing
* [ ] Add destination: jonathan.jewell@open.ac.uk
* [ ] Create forwarding rules:
  - info@axel-protocol.org
  - security@axel-protocol.org
  - conduct@axel-protocol.org
  - membership@axel-protocol.org
  - tsc@axel-protocol.org
* [ ] Test email delivery

== Phase 2: Coalition Building

=== Week 1-2: Industry Research (5-10 contacts)

*Goal:* Understand real-world pain points

*Targets:*
- Smaller ethical platforms (Bellesa, Lustery, FrolicMe)
- Larger platforms (OnlyFans, Aylo/Pornhub)

*Method:* LinkedIn outreach, informal 15-minute conversations

*Expected outcome:* 2-3 responses validating compliance pain points

=== Week 3-4: Privacy Review (1-2 organizations)

*Goal:* Get privacy validation

*Targets:*
- Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
- Open Rights Group (UK)

*Method:* Contact form submission / email

*Expected outcome:* One privacy org agrees to review protocol

=== Week 5-6: Academic Outreach (3-5 researchers)

*Goal:* Get formal verification / pilot study partners

*Targets:*
- Open University colleagues (start internal)
- UCL Information Security Group
- Cambridge Computer Lab
- St Andrews (Edwin Brady - Idris2 creator)

*Method:* Email with research collaboration pitch

*Expected outcome:* 1-2 academic collaborators

=== Week 7-8: Consolidate Feedback

*Activities:*
- Synthesize all feedback
- Update specification based on real-world constraints
- Refine governance structure
- Prepare for formal platform engagement

== Phase 3: Formal Platform Engagement (Month 3+)

*When:* After coalition backing secured

*Approach:* Standards body with credibility, not supplicant

*Pitch elements:*
- Payment processor compliance (Mastercard requirements)
- Legal safe harbor (UK OSA, EU DSA)
- Privacy preservation (DoQ/OHTTP)
- Bandwidth optimization (IPv6 QoS)

== Phase 4: Standards Submission (Month 6-12)

=== Pilot Deployments
* [ ] Select 2-3 platforms for pilots
* [ ] Deploy reference implementation
* [ ] Collect effectiveness data

=== IETF Submission
* [ ] Draft RFC for AXEL-STS
* [ ] Submit to IETF DNS working group
* [ ] Iterate based on feedback

=== IANA Registration
* [ ] Apply for port allocation (port 459 proposed)
* [ ] Register well-known URI (.well-known/axel/)
