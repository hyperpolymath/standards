= AXEL Protocol
:toc: auto

**AXEL** = **A**ccess for e**X**plicit **E**nforcement & **L**abeling

An IPv6-based protocol for isolating age-restricted content using DNS-based enforcement mechanisms, authorized IP prefix lists, and privacy-preserving attestation. AXEL addresses the failures of voluntary content labeling systems (ICRA, PICS) by providing technical enforcement at the network layer.

== Key Features

* **AXEL-STS**: Strict Transport Security for age-restricted content
* **APL Records**: DNS-based authorized IP prefix lists
* **Privacy-Preserving Attestation**: Zero-knowledge proofs for age verification
* **IPv6-First**: Designed for modern internet infrastructure
* **Network-Level Enforcement**: DNS and firewall integration

== Architecture

* *ReScript* - Type-safe AXEL-STS validator
* *Deno* - Modern runtime (no Node.js)
* *proven* - Formally verified domain validation (Idris2)
* *Zig FFI* - C-compatible implementation layer

== Development

== Status (2026-01-31)

* ✅ AXEL Protocol Specification (v1.0.0-draft)
* ✅ ReScript AXEL-STS validator
* ✅ Firewall configuration (firewalld)
* ✅ Containerfile for deployment
* ✅ Security hardening complete
* ⏳ IANA port assignment request (port 459)
* ⏳ Production attestation service
* ⏳ Browser extension for client-side enforcement

== Roadmap

=== Phase 1: Specification & Reference Implementation (Current)
* [x] AXEL Protocol specification document
* [x] DNS record formats (AXEL-STS, APL)
* [x] ReScript validator implementation
* [ ] Reference attestation service
* [ ] IANA registrations (.well-known URI, port 459, flow label)

=== Phase 2: Deployment Tools
* [ ] firewalld integration
* [ ] DNS zone file generators
* [ ] Terraform/Ansible deployment scripts
* [ ] Browser extension for AXEL enforcement

=== Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration
* [ ] CDN provider integration (Cloudflare, Fastly)
* [ ] CMS plugins (WordPress, Drupal)
* [ ] OpenSSF Scorecard compliance
* [ ] Public AXEL registry
