== License & Philosophy

This project must declare **MPL-2.0-or-later** for platform/tooling compatibility.

Philosophy: **Palimpsest**. The Palimpsest-MPL (PMPL) text is provided in `license/PMPL-1.0.txt`, and the canonical source is the palimpsest-license repository.

== Overview

AGENTIC.scm defines **operational gating policies** for AI agent actions. It controls
*whether* a permitted action may proceed *now*, separate from constitutional permission
(META) or semantic meaning (NEUROSYM).

AGENTIC implements safety controls including:

* **Entropy Budgets** - Track accumulated operational risk
* **Risk Thresholds** - Classify operations by risk level
* **Confirmation Requirements** - Explicit user intent for high-risk operations
* **Decision Recording** - Auditable trail of all gating decisions

== SCM Format Family

This specification is part of the SCM Format Family:

== Execution Pipeline Position

AGENTIC operates at step 2 in the execution pipeline:

[source]
----
1. META validation      ← Constitutional authority check
2. AGENTIC gating       ← THIS SPECIFICATION
3. NEUROSYM semantics   ← Proof obligations
4. PLAYBOOK derivation  ← Build executable plan
5. Execution
6. ECOSYSTEM check
7. STATE update
----

== Key Concepts

=== Explicit Present Intent

User memories, project memories, or inferred goals MUST NOT be treated as
equivalent to **explicit present user intent**. AGENTIC distinguishes between:

* **Explicit Intent** - Direct, unambiguous request in current interaction
* **Inferred Intent** - Derived from context, patterns, or history
* **No Intent** - No user indication

=== Entropy Budgets

Entropy budgets track accumulated operational risk within a session or timeframe:

[source,scheme]
----
(define entropy-budgets
  '((session
     (max-entropy . 100)
     (current . 0)
     (reset-on . "session-end"))
    (operation-costs
     (file-read . 1)
     (file-write . 5)
     (file-delete . 20)
     (external-api . 10)
     (irreversible-action . 50))))
----

=== Override Requirements

If AGENTIC blocks an action, it MAY be overridden ONLY if:

1. META defines the override class
2. The user provides explicit present intent
3. The action is retyped appropriately if proof obligations are not discharged

All overrides MUST be recorded as decision records.

== Quick Start

=== Minimal AGENTIC.scm

[source,scheme]
----
(define-module (my-project agentic)
  #:export (gating-policies))

(define gating-policies
  '((default
     (mode . "strict")
     (require-explicit-intent . #t))))
----

See `examples/` for more complete examples.
