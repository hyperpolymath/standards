# test_governance_r5_bash_e.sh — runs the R5 canonical-reference drift step of
# .github/workflows/governance-reusable.yml exactly as a runner does: the step's
# `run:` text, extracted with yq, under `bash -e` (a step with no `shell:` runs
# as `bash -e {0}` on ubuntu runners).
#
# Regression: under `-e`, `out=$(grep …)` on an include file with no match
# returned 1 and aborted the step before `rc=$?` — exit 1, no output, no
# annotation. echidna#410 went red on clean content. The planted-hit cases are
# the positive control: a real drift must still fail and name the line.
