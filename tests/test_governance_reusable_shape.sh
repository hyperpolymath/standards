# test_governance_reusable_shape.sh — structural guards on
# .github/workflows/governance-reusable.yml (spec 2026-09-02-cicd-regularisation
# §6.2, §6.4; PR 2a). These are the properties a red MUST be able to name:
#
#   1. CONTEXT FREEZE: the set of reusable job `name:` values is exactly the
#      frozen list. Every live ruleset types "<caller job id> / <job name>"; a
#      rename turns that context into a phantom on ~350 repos. Adding a job is
#      allowed (it adds a context); renaming or removing one is not, until the
#      applier (step 3) derives contexts from emitted check-runs.
#   2. Every job honours `inputs.runs-on` (no hardcoded runner).
#   3. `actions-lock-verify` is its own job, runs the tested gate script, and
#      checks standards out at job.workflow_sha (the reusable's own SHA), never
#      at a floating `main`.
#   4. The lock check no longer hides inside workflow-lint.
#   5. `continue-on-error: true` appears only in the jobs listed as advisory or
#      on a fetch step whose absence a later step turns into ::error.
#   6. Every advisory job name is excluded from ruleset derivation via
#      config/rulesets/gates.json never_required_contexts.
