# test_tag_ruleset_canon.sh — structural guards on the tag-ruleset canon and on
# the applier that deploys it. These exist because of a measured four-day
# outage: on 2026-09-11 a body carrying a `creation` rule and an EMPTY
# `bypass_actors` list was committed to config/rulesets/ and deployed to 372
# repositories, after which nobody -- including the owner -- could create a tag
# anywhere. CodeRabbit corrected the file the next morning; the correction was
# never re-deployed, because nothing committed reads config/rulesets/.
#
# These are the properties a red MUST be able to name:
#
#   1. CANON IS USABLE: the tag canon restricts `creation` but keeps at least one
#      bypass actor. A tag ruleset with `creation` and zero bypass actors is not
#      "strict", it is an outage, and it is exactly what shipped.
#   2. NO CASE COLLISION: at most one file in config/rulesets/ declares a
#      tag ruleset over ~ALL. Two files whose names differ only by case
#      (`Immutable-Tags.json` vs `immutable-tags.json`) is how the wrong body
#      got deployed while the right one sat beside it.
#   3. IDENTITY, NOT NAME: the applier must never classify a live ruleset by its
#      `name`, and must strip `name` from a PUT body — GitHub keeps whatever name
#      an existing ruleset has, so sending one silently renames it. Measured:
#      372 repos named `Immutable-Tags` were blocked, 26 with that same name were
#      not, and 2 named `Immutable Tags` were healthy. The name classifies
#      nothing.
#   4. TWO-STEP READ: the applier must GET each ruleset by id. The LIST endpoint
#      omits `conditions`, `rules` and `bypass_actors`, so filtering the list
#      matches nothing (0 of 178 live repos) and every PUT silently becomes a
#      POST, recreating the duplicate-ruleset outage.
#   5. NO SILENT WEAKER FALLBACK: the applier must not carry a second, admin-only
#      canon body to fall back on when an App is not installed. One body
#      everywhere is the decision; a fallback re-creates a two-variant estate.
#   6. FAIL CLOSED ON DUPLICATES: rulesets are ADDITIVE, so a zero-bypass rival
#      blocks tags even beside a healthy sibling. The applier must refuse a repo
#      carrying two rather than guessing.
#   7. WRITES ARE OPT-IN: the applier reports unless `--apply` is passed.
#   8. CREDENTIAL IS ASSERTED: an absent secret resolves to an empty string in
#      silence; the applier must exit non-zero before enumerating anything.
#   9. BOTH OWNERS ENUMERATED: `user/repos?affiliation=owner` returns ZERO
#      organisation repositories. metadatastician is an organisation, and a
#      census from the user endpoint alone silently missed 212 live repos.
