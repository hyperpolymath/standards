# test_apply_workflow_pins_remote.sh — regression suite for the pin applier.
#
# This suite is MUTATION-BASED on purpose. A green run of the applier's own
# controls proves only that the controls agree with the code; it does not prove
# the controls can DETECT anything. So every mutant below reintroduces a real
# defect verbatim and asserts the suite turns red. A mutant that stays green is
# a control that was never testing what its name claims.
#
# Trap already paid for once: a syntactically INVALID mutant fails for the wrong
# reason and every control "fails" on a parse error, which reads as success.
# Each mutant is therefore `bash -n`-checked BEFORE its redness is believed.
