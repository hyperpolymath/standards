This document defines the decision-making framework, contribution model, and governance structure for the Consent-Aware HTTP Standards Project.

== Overview

=== Project Mission

To establish standardized, consent-aware protocols for AI usage boundaries on the web through:

* Internet-Draft specifications (HTTP 430, AIBDP)
* Reference implementations and tooling
* Educational materials and community building
* Ethical framework grounded in journalism ethics and consent theory

=== Core Values

[quote]
____
*Boundary* as dignity +
*Consent* as care +
*Transparency* over hidden permissions +
*Community* over extraction
____

== Governance Model

=== Current Phase: Benevolent Dictator Temporarily (BDT)

**Lead Maintainer**: Jonathan D.A. Jewell

**Rationale**: During initial development and IETF standardization process, centralized technical leadership ensures:

* Specification coherence
* IETF submission coordination
* Ethical framework integrity
* Rapid iteration on core protocols

**Transition Timeline**: Move to Steering Committee once:

* HTTP 430 achieves IETF Working Group status
* AIBDP specification stabilizes
* 3+ co-maintainers with 6+ months sustained contribution
* Community reaches 50+ active participants

=== Future Phase: Steering Committee

When mature, governance will transition to a Steering Committee model:

|Public reputation, community norms

|**Perimeter 2** +
(Expert)
|Review PRs, write access to feature branches, mentor others

|Perimeter 1 oversight, removal for repeated issues

|**Perimeter 1** +
(Maintainer)

|Ensure spec quality, security review, community health, ethical coherence
|Community accountability, formal removal process

|===

== Conflict Resolution

=== Escalation Path

. **Discussion**: Attempt to resolve through respectful dialogue
. **Mediation**: Involve neutral Perimeter 1 maintainer
. **Lead Decision**: Lead Maintainer makes final call
. **Community Appeal**: Formal appeal to Steering Committee (future phase)

=== Code of Conduct Violations

See link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md] for enforcement procedures.

**Reporting**: jonathan@metadatastician.art or designated CoC contact +
**Timeline**: Acknowledgment within 48 hours, decision within 14 days +
**Appeals**: May be submitted within 30 days of decision

== Financial Governance

=== Funding Principles

* **Voluntary**: No payment required for use
* **Transparent**: All funding sources public (link:FUNDING.yml[FUNDING.yml])
* **Community-directed**: Funds support project goals, not individual enrichment
* **Ethical**: No corporate capture, no dark patterns

=== Current Funding Model

* Individual donations (Ko-fi, PayPal)
* Potential future: OpenCollective, Liberapay, grant funding
* No corporate sponsorships requiring editorial control

=== Fund Allocation (Target)

**Financial Reports**: Quarterly transparency reports (when funding >$500/month)

== Standards Process

=== IETF Coordination

**Lead**: Jonathan D.A. Jewell (current) +
**Process**:

. **Long-term (>3 months)**: Trigger election for new Lead Maintainer
. **Permanent**: Formal leadership transition, governance update

=== Project Archival (If Necessary)

If project must be archived:

. **Notice**: 90-day advance notice to community
. **Documentation**: Comprehensive archival documentation
. **Data**: Export all data, enable forks
. **Domain**: Transfer to community steward or allow expiration
. **Standards**: Ensure IETF drafts are properly withdrawn or transferred

== Amendments to Governance

=== Proposal Process

== Appendix: Governance Philosophy

[quote]
____
*Governance is consent infrastructure.* +
Just as AIBDP declares boundaries for AI use, this governance framework declares boundaries for project participation and decision-making.
____

=== Principles

* **Explicit over Implicit**: Clear rules prevent confusion and conflict
* **Graduated Trust**: TPCF balances openness with quality
* **Accountable Power**: Authority comes with responsibility
* **Reversible Decisions**: Most decisions can be revisited (except security)
* **Community-Centered**: Project serves adopters and contributors, not maintainers

=== Influences

* **IndieWeb**: Self-governance and federated decision-making
* **IETF**: Rough consensus and running code
* **Debian**: Constitutional governance and social contract
* **Apache Foundation**: Meritocracy and community over code

____
"Without refusal, permission is meaningless." +
This applies to governance too: The right to fork, to leave, to say no - these preserve project health.
