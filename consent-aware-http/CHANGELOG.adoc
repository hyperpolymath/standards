  - `LICENSE.md` with clear code/documentation separation

=== Philosophy
- Established core principle: "Without refusal, permission is meaningless"
- Integrated cultural theory (bell hooks, Virginia Woolf, journalism ethics)
- Positioned protocol as pro-boundary, not anti-AI
- Emphasized declarative refusal as care and dignity

=== Standards Position
- Prepared for IETF submission
- Aligned with RFC 7991 (xml2rfc v3) specification format
- Distinguished HTTP 430 from existing status codes (403, 428, 451)
- Designed for compatibility with federated and centralized architectures

== Version Numbering

Internet-Drafts follow IETF conventions:
- `draft-jewell-http-430-consent-required-NN` where NN is revision number (00, 01, 02...)
- `draft-jewell-aibdp-NN` for AIBDP protocol specification

Repository releases use semantic versioning:
- **MAJOR**: Fundamental protocol changes requiring broad adoption updates
- **MINOR**: New features, documentation expansions, additional examples
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, typo corrections, clarifications

== Release Process

1. Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes since last release
2. Update version numbers in relevant Internet-Draft XML files
3. Generate rendered versions (HTML, PDF) via build scripts
4. Tag release: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"`
5. Push tag: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
6. Create GitHub Release with summary and links to rendered drafts
7. Announce in community channels (IndieWeb, Fediverse, mailing lists)
