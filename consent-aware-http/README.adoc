[.lead]
This repository hosts formal proposals, implementation materials, and ethical guidance for consent-aware architecture in the age of generative systems. At its heart are two interlinked Internet-Drafts designed to enforce procedural refusals when AI usage boundaries are unmet or ignored.

== Overview

=== HTTP Status Code 430: Consent Required

🚦 *draft-jewell-http-430-consent-required*

Defines HTTP Status Code 430 (Consent Required), enabling servers to reject access when AI-specific consent declarations are invalid, missing, or violated. It empowers refusal not as punishment, but as principled perimeter enforcement.

**Status**: Internet-Draft 00 (IETF submission ready) +
**Specification**: link:draft-jewell-http-430-consent-required-00.xml[XML] | link:rendered/draft-430.txt[Text] | link:rendered/draft-430.html[HTML]

=== AI Boundary Declaration Protocol (AIBDP)

🧭 *draft-jewell-aibdp*

Introduces the AI Boundary Declaration Protocol (AIBDP) - a machine-readable manifest (`/.well-known/aibdp.json`) for signaling what forms of AI engagement are permitted. It formalizes intent, fosters transparency, and restores agency to originators.

**Status**: Internet-Draft 00 (IETF submission ready) +
**Specification**: link:drafts/draft-jewell-aibdp-00.xml[XML] | link:rendered/draft-aibdp.txt[Text] | link:rendered/draft-aibdp.html[HTML]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Together, these protocols establish declarative boundaries that resist unauthorized training, indexing, or generative reuse - compatible with federated infrastructure and public web publishing alike.

== Why This Matters

[.lead]
AI systems often ingest, embed, and regenerate content without consent - erasing boundary, authorship, and intent.

These protocols restore **procedural clarity** to web interactions, allowing creators to:

* ✅ **Refuse generative reuse** without legal escalation
* ✅ **Declare acceptable AI uses** in a standardized way
* ✅ **Signal denial** with structured protocol, not vague error codes
* ✅ **Collaborate** on infrastructure that respects ethical constraints

== Getting Started

=== Quick Implementation (4 Steps)

. **Create AIBDP Manifest** +
  Add `/.well-known/aibdp.json` with your declared boundaries
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "aibdp_version": "0.2",
  "contact": "mailto:policy@example.org",
  "policies": {
    "training": { "status": "refused" },
    "indexing": { "status": "allowed" }
  }
}
----

. **Configure Server** +
  Update server logic to respond with HTTP 430 when violations occur
+
[source,nginx]
----
location = /.well-known/aibdp.json {
    add_header Content-Type application/aibdp+json;
}
----

. **Use Templates** +
  See link:docs/start-here.md[start-here.md] for templates, examples, and server configs

. **Join Community** +
  Engage in IndieWeb, Fediverse, or IETF circles to promote shared adoption

[TIP]
====
These standards can be implemented independently of platform, license, or scale - ideal for personal blogs, union archives, CDN layers, or federated identity services.

== Ethics and Governance

[.lead]
This project draws on traditions of ethical journalism, federated systems, and authorship dignity.

=== Core Values

[quote]
____
*Declarative refusal* as a form of care +
*Boundary* as the place where meaning begins +
*Transparent infrastructure* over implied permissions +
*Sanctuary work* as both cultural and procedural
____

=== Philosophical Foundations

* **bell hooks**: Boundary-setting as dignity and care
* **Virginia Woolf**: Architectural refusal as self-determination
* **Journalism Ethics**: Right to decline co-option (NUJ, SPJ)
* **IndieWeb**: Self-sovereignty and federated control

== Validation & Testing

=== Quick Validation

[source,bash]
----
# Validate all manifests and specs
just validate

# Check RSR compliance
just check-rsr

# Run tests
just test

# Build Internet-Drafts
just build-drafts
----

=== Development Environment

Using Nix flakes (reproducible builds):

[source,bash]
----
# Enter dev shell with all tools
nix develop

# Or run specific commands
nix run .#validate
nix run .#check-rsr
----

=== Testing AIBDP Implementation

[source,bash]
----
# Test manifest accessibility
curl https://example.org/.well-known/aibdp.json

# Test AI bot blocking (should return 430)
curl https://example.org/articles/ -H "User-Agent: GPTBot/1.0"

# Test normal access (should return 200)
curl https://example.org/ -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0"
----

== Security Considerations

[WARNING]
====
AIBDP is a **declarative protocol**, not a technical enforcement mechanism:

* Non-compliant AI systems may ignore manifests
* Detection requires active monitoring
* Legal/reputational consequences provide primary enforcement
* HTTPS + COSE signatures recommended for high-value content
====

See link:docs/security-analysis.md[security-analysis.md] for comprehensive threat model.
