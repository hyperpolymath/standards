# Solidarity Economics Framework
#
# This project operates on solidarity economics principles:
#
# * VOLUNTARY: Funding is voluntary, not required for use
# * TRANSPARENT: All funding information is public
# * COMMUNITY: Funds support ongoing development and community building
# * ETHICAL: No exploitation, no dark patterns, no guilt
#
# Your support helps sustain:
#
#   - Internet-Draft development and IETF submission
#   - Reference implementation maintenance
#   - Documentation and educational materials
#   - Community outreach and adoption support
#   - Hosting and infrastructure costs
#
# Even small contributions ($5-$20) help maintain this work.
#
# Thank you for supporting consent-aware infrastructure!
