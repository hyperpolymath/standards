# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/standards.git
cd standards

# Using Nix (recommended for reproducibility)
nix develop

# Or using toolbox/distrobox
toolbox create standards-dev
toolbox enter standards-dev
# Install dependencies manually

# Verify setup
just check   # or: cargo check / mix compile / etc.
just test    # Run test suite
```

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

**Before reporting**:
1. Search existing issues
2. Check if it's already fixed in `main`
3. Determine which perimeter the bug affects

**When reporting**:

Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) and include:

- Clear, descriptive title
- Environment details (OS, versions, toolchain)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behaviour
- Logs, screenshots, or minimal reproduction

### Suggesting Features

**Before suggesting**:
1. Check the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) if available
2. Search existing issues and discussions
3. Consider which perimeter the feature belongs to

**When suggesting**:

Use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) and include:

- Problem statement (what pain point does this solve?)
- Proposed solution
- Alternatives considered
- Which perimeter this affects

### Your First Contribution

Look for issues labelled:

- [`good first issue`](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/standards/labels/good%20first%20issue) — Simple Perimeter 3 tasks
- [`help wanted`](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/standards/labels/help%20wanted) — Community help needed
- [`documentation`](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/standards/labels/documentation) — Docs improvements
- [`perimeter-3`](https://github.com/hyperpolymath/standards/labels/perimeter-3) — Community sandbox scope

## Development Workflow

### First: install the pre-commit guard

```sh
just hooks-install
```

This installs `hooks/pre-commit`, which catches the most common CI failure
before it leaves your machine: **registry drift**. The spec registry
(`.machine_readable/REGISTRY.a2ml`) records a content hash of every tracked
file under a spec home, so *any* edit under one (including
`.machine_readable/` itself) must be followed by:

```sh
just registry     # regenerates REGISTRY.a2ml + TOPOLOGY.md
git add .machine_readable/REGISTRY.a2ml TOPOLOGY.md
```

If you skip this, the required "Registry + topology in sync" check fails —
and because it is a required check, stale registry hashes on `main` block
*every* open PR, not just yours (see #381). The hook fails the commit with
the exact fix commands whenever the registry is stale.
