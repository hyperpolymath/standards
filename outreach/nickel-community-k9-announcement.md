Hi Nickel community! 👋

I've been working on **K9**, a framework for building self-validating infrastructure components using Nickel, and I wanted to share it with you since Nickel is at the heart of the design.

## What is K9?

K9 (pronounced "canine") is a format for infrastructure automation that combines:
- **must** (Bash) - System validation
- **just** (Justfile) - Execution recipes
- **nickel** (Nickel contracts) - Configuration schema

All wrapped in a single `.k9.ncl` file that's valid Nickel code.

## Example: Setting Up Rust Development

```nickel
# SPDX-License-Identifier: PMPL-1.0-or-later
# setup-rust-env.k9.ncl

{
  metadata = {
    name = "rust-dev-env",
    version = "1.0.0",
    security_level = "yard",
  },

  must = {
    check = ''
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      # Validate: Is Rust installed?
      command -v rustc &> /dev/null
    '',
  },

  just = {
    recipes = {
      install = {
        description = "Install Rust toolchain",
        commands = [
          "curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y",
          "source $HOME/.cargo/env",
        ],
      },
    },
  },

  nickel = {
    config | {
      rust_version | String = "stable",
      components | List String = ["rustfmt", "clippy"],
    } = {
      rust_version = "stable",
      components = ["rustfmt", "clippy", "rust-analyzer"],
    },
  },
}
```

## Why Nickel?

I chose Nickel for K9 because:

1. **Gradual typing** - Start simple, add contracts as needed
2. **Configuration validation** - Catch errors before execution
3. **Merging** - Compose configurations naturally
4. **JSON output** - Easy integration with other tools

The `nickel` section of K9 contractiles uses Nickel contracts to validate configuration before any execution happens. This prevents common infrastructure errors.

## Meta-Dogfooding

Here's where it gets fun: **K9 releases itself using a K9 component**!

See: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-svc/blob/main/release-k9.k9.ncl

This contractile:
- Validates the build environment
- Bumps version numbers
- Runs tests
- Creates GitHub releases
- All automated via the must-just-nickel triad

## Three Security Levels

K9 has three security levels inspired by dog behavior:

- **Kennel** (read-only) - Safe operations only (ls, cat, stat)
- **Yard** (moderate) - File writes, git ops, package installs
- **Hunt** (full access) - Requires cryptographic signatures

## Tools

I've built a complete tooling suite:

- **k9-init** - Scaffold new K9 contractiles from templates
- **k9-validate** - Standalone validator
- **k9-sign** - Ed25519 signing for hunt-level contractiles
- **GitHub Action** - CI/CD integration
- **VS Code Extension** - Syntax highlighting + validation

See: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-tools

## Current Adoption

K9 is being used in 10 repos across the Hyperpolymath ecosystem:
- Development environment setup
- Release automation
- Deployment workflows
- CI/CD pipelines
- And K9 releasing itself!

## Try It

```bash
# Clone and try k9-tools
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-tools.git
cd k9-tools

# Build tools
make build

# Create a new K9 contractile
./src/k9-init/target/release/k9-init --template minimal

# Validate it
./src/k9-validate/target/release/k9-validate my-contractile.k9.ncl
```

## Feedback Welcome!

I'd love to hear thoughts from the Nickel community:

1. **Does this feel natural in Nickel?** The `nickel` section uses standard Nickel contracts
2. **Contract improvements?** How can I better leverage Nickel's type system?
3. **Integration ideas?** What else could integrate with K9?

Thanks for building such an excellent configuration language! K9 wouldn't be possible without Nickel's solid foundation.
