# Hacker News Post: K9 Meta-Dogfooding

## Title
K9: When your release tool releases itself (meta-dogfooding infrastructure automation)

## Post Body

Dogfooding—using your own product—is a standard way to validate software. But what if you take it one step further? What if your automation tool automates *itself*?

I built K9, a framework for self-validating infrastructure components. Then I made K9 release itself using a K9 component.

**What is K9?**

K9 components (called "contractiles") are `.k9.ncl` files with three parts:

1. **must** (Bash) - Validates prerequisites before execution
2. **just** (Justfile) - Defines execution recipes
3. **nickel** (Nickel contracts) - Configuration schema

Example:
```nickel
{
  must = {
    check = ''
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      command -v docker &> /dev/null
    '',
  },

  just = {
    recipes = {
      deploy = {
        commands = ["docker-compose up -d"],
      },
    },
  },

  nickel = {
    config = {
      port = 8080,
    },
  },
}
```

Before running `just deploy`, K9 executes `must.check`. If Docker isn't installed, it fails fast with a clear error. No "works on my machine" surprises.

**The Meta-Dogfooding Moment:**

After using K9 for 10 projects (dev environment setup, deployments, CI/CD), I realized: K9's own releases should be automated with K9.

So I created `release-k9.k9.ncl`:

```nickel
{
  must = {
    check = ''
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      command -v git &> /dev/null || exit 1
      command -v gh &> /dev/null || exit 1
      git diff --quiet || exit 1  # No uncommitted changes
    '',
  },

  just = {
    recipes = {
      "bump-version" = {
        commands = [
          "sed -i 's/version = \"0.9.0\"/version = \"1.0.0\"/' Cargo.toml",
          "git add Cargo.toml",
        ],
      },

      release = {
        dependencies = ["bump-version", "test"],
        commands = [
          "git commit -m 'chore: bump version to 1.0.0'",
          "git tag v1.0.0",
          "git push origin main --tags",
          "gh release create v1.0.0 --generate-notes",
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

When `release-k9.k9.ncl` successfully released K9 v1.0.0, it proved three things:

1. **Self-validation works** - Caught uncommitted changes, missing tools, wrong directory
2. **Recipe dependencies work** - `release` waited for `bump-version` and `test`
3. **The format is usable** - If K9 can automate complex releases, it handles simpler tasks

**Why Meta-Dogfooding Matters:**

Meta-dogfooding reveals design flaws regular dogfooding misses:
- Recursion edge cases (what happens when K9 validates itself?)
- Error propagation (how do nested recipe dependencies fail?)
- UX friction (is the format too verbose for its own releases?)

If your tool can't automate itself, it probably can't automate complex real-world workflows either.

**Three Lessons Learned:**

**1. Validation Before Execution Is Critical**
Every K9 component failed at least once during development. Having `must.check` run before any recipes saved hours debugging half-executed workflows.

**2. Security Levels Need Clear Boundaries**
K9 has three security levels (inspired by dog behavior):
- **Kennel** (read-only): ls, cat, stat
- **Yard** (moderate): file writes, git ops
- **Hunt** (full access): requires Ed25519 signatures

`release-k9.k9.ncl` is yard-level (git writes, tests) but doesn't need hunt privileges (system admin). The boundaries worked without being restrictive.

**3. Nickel Contracts Catch Config Errors**
The `nickel` section validates configuration before execution:

```nickel
nickel = {
  config | {
    current_version | String,
    new_version | String,
    github_repo | String,
  } = ...
}
```

Forget `github_repo`? Nickel fails at parse time, not mid-release.

**The Result:**

K9 now has a battle-tested release process:
```bash
just -f release-k9.k9.ncl must    # Validate environment
just -f release-k9.k9.ncl release # Run release
```

No manual steps. No forgotten tags. No "did I run the tests?" anxiety.

**Tools Built:**
- **k9-init**: Scaffold contractiles from templates (8 templates: web-server, build, deploy, dev-env, ci-cd, backup, monitoring, minimal)
- **k9-validate**: Standalone validator with dangerous pattern detection
- **k9-sign**: Ed25519 signing for hunt-level components
- **GitHub Action**: CI/CD integration
- **VS Code Extension**: Syntax highlighting, live validation

**Adoption:**
10 repos using K9 across my projects, including K9 releasing itself.

**Why K9?**
The name comes from "canine" (K9). Dogs have three behavioral states: kennel (confined), yard (supervised), hunt (autonomous). Infrastructure needs the same gradual trust model.

Also, I'm dogfooding it. Literally.

**Links:**
- Spec: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-svc
- Tools: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-tools
- Examples: 10+ real contractiles across repos

**Try it:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-tools
cd k9-tools
make build
./src/k9-init/target/release/k9-init --template minimal
```

**The Bigger Question:**

If your automation tool can automate itself, you've validated something important: the abstraction works. Not just in theory, not just for toy examples, but for real, complex workflows.

That's the power of meta-dogfooding.

Curious what HN thinks: Is meta-dogfooding a useful validation technique? What other tools could release themselves?

## Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not just use Make/Justfile/Taskfile directly?**
A: Those are execution engines. K9 adds two things they lack: (1) prerequisite validation before execution, and (2) configuration schemas with Nickel contracts. K9 uses Justfile under the hood—it's a layer on top, not a replacement.

**Q: Isn't this just shell scripts with extra steps?**
A: Sort of, but the "extra steps" matter. Shell scripts fail mid-execution when prerequisites are missing. K9 validates first, fails fast, and provides structured configuration. For simple tasks, shell scripts are fine. For complex workflows, K9 prevents foot-guns.

**Q: Why Nickel? Why not YAML/TOML/JSON?**
A: Nickel has contracts (gradual typing for configuration). You can specify `port | Number` and Nickel ensures it's a number at parse time. YAML/TOML/JSON don't validate schema. Also, Nickel has better merging and composability than JSON/YAML.

**Q: What's with the dog metaphors?**
A: Security levels needed memorable names. "Kennel/Yard/Hunt" maps to "read-only/moderate/full-access" and reflects how much autonomy the component has. It's easier to remember than "Level 0/1/2" or "Safe/Unsafe/Privileged".

**Q: How is this different from Ansible/Terraform?**
A: Ansible/Terraform are domain-specific (infrastructure provisioning). K9 is general-purpose (any automation). Also, K9 is file-based (single .k9.ncl files), not state-based like Terraform. Different abstraction levels.

**Q: Can K9 components call other K9 components?**
A: Yes. Recipes can run `just -f other-component.k9.ncl recipe-name`. This enables composition. For example, a deployment contractile could call a backup contractile before deploying.

**Q: What prevents infinite recursion (K9 releasing K9 releasing K9...)?**
A: The `must.check` validation. `release-k9.k9.ncl` requires uncommitted changes to be absent. After a release, the working tree is clean, so running it again does nothing (no version bump to commit).

**Q: Ed25519 signatures seem heavy. Why not just trust the code?**
A: For kennel/yard levels, you can. Hunt-level components have system-wide privileges (e.g., `sudo`). Signatures prevent unauthorized escalation—someone can't sneak `rm -rf /` into a hunt-level contractile without your private key.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: Depends on your definition. I'm using it in production for 10 repos (including releasing itself). The tooling is v1.0. The spec is stable. But it's a small ecosystem—you're an early adopter.

**Q: What's PMPL-1.0?**
A: Polymath Public Meta-License. It's an open-source license designed for meta-tools (tools that generate/validate other tools). Similar to MPL-2.0 but with provisions for generated artifacts. Details: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-svc/blob/main/LICENSE

**Q: Can I use K9 without Nickel?**
A: Technically, yes—the `nickel` section is optional. But you lose configuration validation. K9 without Nickel is just Justfile with prerequisite checks. Still useful, but not the full power.

**Q: Why create a new format instead of extending Justfile?**
A: Justfile doesn't have prerequisite validation or configuration schemas. Adding those would break Justfile's simplicity. K9 is a different abstraction: self-validating components vs. simple task runners.

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't claim K9 replaces everything (Ansible, Terraform, Make all have their place)
- Don't oversell security (Ed25519 is solid, but it's not magic)
- Don't ignore "why not just use X" questions (valid comparisons)
- Don't get defensive about Nickel's small ecosystem (acknowledge trade-off)

**Follow-up content:**
- If popular, write a "K9 in 5 minutes" tutorial
