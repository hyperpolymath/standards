## The Ultimate Dogfooding Test

Dogfooding—using your own product—is a time-honored way to validate design decisions. But what if you take it one step further? What if your automation tool automates *itself*?

That's **meta-dogfooding**, and it's exactly what I did with K9.

## What is K9?

K9 is a framework for building self-validating infrastructure components. Each K9 "contractile" (`.k9.ncl` file) contains three parts:

1. **must** (Bash) - Validates prerequisites
2. **just** (Justfile) - Defines execution recipes
3. **nickel** (Nickel contracts) - Configuration schema

Here's a simple example:

```nickel
{
  must = {
    check = ''
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      command -v docker &> /dev/null
    '',
  },

  just = {
    recipes = {
      deploy = {
        commands = ["docker-compose up -d"],
      },
    },
  },

  nickel = {
    config = {
      port = 8080,
    },
  },
}
```

Before executing `just deploy`, K9 runs the `must.check` script. If Docker isn't installed, it fails fast with a clear error. No more "works on my machine" surprises.

## The Meta-Dogfooding Moment

After building several K9 components (dev environment setup, deployment workflows, etc.), I realized: **K9 releases should be automated with K9 itself**.

So I created `release-k9.k9.ncl` - a K9 contractile that releases K9:

```nickel
{
  must = {
    check = ''
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      # Validate release environment
      command -v git &> /dev/null || exit 1
      command -v gh &> /dev/null || exit 1
      git diff --quiet || exit 1  # No uncommitted changes
    '',
  },

  just = {
    recipes = {
      "bump-version" = {
        commands = [
          "sed -i 's/version = \"0.9.0\"/version = \"1.0.0\"/' Cargo.toml",
          "git add Cargo.toml",
        ],
      },

      release = {
        dependencies = ["bump-version", "test"],
        commands = [
          "git commit -m 'chore: bump version to 1.0.0'",
          "git tag v1.0.0",
          "git push origin main --tags",
          "gh release create v1.0.0 --title 'K9 v1.0.0' --generate-notes",
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## What This Proves

When `release-k9.k9.ncl` successfully released K9 v1.0.0, it validated three design decisions:

**1. Self-validation works**
The `must.check` script caught issues before execution:
- Uncommitted changes → failed fast
- Missing `gh` CLI → failed with clear error
- Wrong directory → failed immediately

**2. Recipe dependencies work**
The `release` recipe correctly waited for `bump-version` and `test` to complete.

**3. The format is usable**
If K9 can automate its own complex release workflow (version bumping, testing, tagging, GitHub release creation), it can handle simpler tasks for other projects.

## Why Meta-Dogfooding Matters

Meta-dogfooding reveals design flaws that regular dogfooding misses:

- **Recursion edge cases**: What happens when K9 validates itself?
- **Error propagation**: How do nested recipe dependencies fail?
- **UX friction**: Is the format too verbose for its own releases?

If your tool can't automate itself, it probably can't automate complex real-world workflows either.

## Three Lessons Learned

### 1. Validation Before Execution Is Critical

Every K9 component failed at least once during development. Having `must.check` run *before* any recipes execute saved hours of debugging half-executed workflows.

### 2. Security Levels Need Clear Boundaries

K9 has three security levels:
- **Kennel** - Read-only (safe default)
- **Yard** - File writes, git ops
- **Hunt** - Full system access (requires signatures)

`release-k9.k9.ncl` is yard-level (writes to git, runs tests) but doesn't need hunt-level privileges (no system administration). The boundaries work.

### 3. Nickel Contracts Catch Configuration Errors

The `nickel` section validates configuration before execution:

```nickel
nickel = {
  config | {
    current_version | String,
    new_version | String,
    github_repo | String,
  } = ...
}
```

If you forget to set `github_repo`, Nickel fails at parse time, not mid-release.

## The Result

K9 now has a battle-tested release process:

```bash
# Validate release environment
just -f release-k9.k9.ncl must

# Run release
just -f release-k9.k9.ncl release
```

No manual steps. No forgotten tags. No "did I run the tests?" anxiety.

## Try It Yourself

K9 is open source:

- **Spec:** https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-svc
- **Tools:** https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-tools
- **Examples:** 10 real-world contractiles across multiple repos

And yes, the tools that help you create K9 contractiles... will eventually be released with K9 too. Meta-dogfooding all the way down.

## Conclusion

If your automation tool can automate itself, you've validated something important: the abstraction works. Not just in theory, not just for toy examples, but for real, complex workflows.

That's the power of meta-dogfooding.
