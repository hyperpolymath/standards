## Elevator Pitch (300 characters)

Dogfooding is validating. Meta-dogfooding is enlightening. K9 is an infrastructure automation framework that releases itself using its own automation primitives. This talk shows how building a tool that automates itself reveals design flaws invisible to traditional dogfooding.

## Abstract

Every infrastructure automation tool claims to simplify deployments and reduce errors. But how do you validate those claims? By making the tool automate *itself*.

K9 is a self-validating infrastructure framework where each component (called a "contractile") contains three parts:

1. **must** (Bash) - Prerequisites validation
2. **just** (Justfile) - Execution recipes
3. **nickel** (Nickel contracts) - Configuration schema

Here's the twist: K9's v1.0.0 release was automated by a K9 contractile (`release-k9.k9.ncl`). The release tool released itself.

This talk explores what happens when you push dogfooding to its logical extreme:

**What We Built:**
- A framework for self-validating infrastructure components
- Three security levels (kennel/yard/hunt) inspired by dog behavior
- Tools to scaffold, validate, and sign contractiles
- GitHub Actions, VS Code extensions, and CLI tooling

**What We Learned:**
- Meta-dogfooding catches edge cases regular dogfooding misses
- Self-validation reveals circular dependency issues
- Recipe execution order matters more than expected
- Configuration errors should fail at parse time, not mid-deployment

**Live Demo:**
We'll watch K9 validate its own release environment, bump version numbers, run tests, create GitHub releases, and publish artifacts—all automated by K9 itself.

This isn't just a clever trick. It's a validation technique that proves the abstraction works for complex, real-world workflows. If your tool can't automate itself, can it really automate production systems?

## Description (Detailed Outline)

### Act 1: The Problem (8 minutes)

**The Infrastructure Automation Landscape:**
- DevOps has 1000+ tools (Terraform, Ansible, Helm, Make, Just, etc.)
- Each solves a narrow slice of the problem
- No standard way to validate prerequisites before execution
- Configuration errors discovered mid-deployment (the worst time)

**A Real Story:**
```bash
$ terraform apply
# 15 minutes later...
Error: AWS credentials not configured
```

That's 15 minutes of wasted time because prerequisite validation happened too late.

**The Core Problem:**
Infrastructure scripts assume prerequisites are met. When they're not, failures are ugly:
- Half-applied state
- Rollback complexity
- "Works on my machine" syndrome

**What if infrastructure components could validate themselves before execution?**

### Act 2: Enter K9 (10 minutes)

**The Design:**

K9 contractiles are single `.k9.ncl` files containing three sections:

```nickel
{
  must = {
    check = ''
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      # Validate: Docker installed?
      command -v docker &> /dev/null
    '',
  },

  just = {
    recipes = {
      deploy = {
        dependencies = ["build"],
        commands = ["docker-compose up -d"],
      },
    },
  },

  nickel = {
    config = {
      port | Number = 8080,
      debug_mode | Bool = false,
    },
  },
}
```

**Execution flow:**
1. Parse Nickel config → catch schema errors
2. Run `must.check` → validate prerequisites
3. Execute `just` recipes → perform operations
4. All or nothing: failures are loud and early

**Three Security Levels (Dog Metaphors):**
- **Kennel** (read-only): Safe operations (ls, cat, stat)
- **Yard** (moderate): File writes, git ops, package installs
- **Hunt** (full access): Requires Ed25519 cryptographic signatures

Why dogs? Dogs have three behavioral states: confined (kennel), supervised (yard), autonomous (hunt). Infrastructure needs the same gradual trust model.

**Demo 1: Simple K9 Contractile**
Show a dev environment setup contractile validating Rust installation before running setup.

### Act 3: The Meta-Dogfooding Moment (12 minutes)

**The Challenge:**
After building K9 and using it for 10 projects, I realized: K9 releases should be automated with K9 itself.

**Enter `release-k9.k9.ncl`:**

```nickel
{
  must = {
    check = ''
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      command -v git &> /dev/null || exit 1
      command -v gh &> /dev/null || exit 1
      git diff --quiet || exit 1  # No uncommitted changes
      [ "$(git branch --show-current)" = "main" ] || exit 1
    '',
  },

  just = {
    recipes = {
      "bump-version" = {
        commands = [
          "sed -i 's/version = \"0.9.0\"/version = \"1.0.0\"/' Cargo.toml",
          "git add Cargo.toml",
        ],
      },

      test = {
        commands = ["cargo test --all"],
      },

      release = {
        dependencies = ["bump-version", "test"],
        commands = [
          "git commit -m 'chore: bump version to 1.0.0'",
          "git tag v1.0.0",
          "git push origin main --tags",
          "gh release create v1.0.0 --generate-notes",
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

**What This Proves:**

When `release-k9.k9.ncl` successfully released K9 v1.0.0, it validated:

1. **Self-validation works**: Caught uncommitted changes, missing tools, wrong branch
2. **Recipe dependencies work**: `release` waited for `bump-version` and `test`
3. **The format is usable**: If K9 can automate complex releases, it handles simpler tasks

**Demo 2: Live K9 Release**
Run `just -f release-k9.k9.ncl must` → show validation catching issues
Run `just -f release-k9.k9.ncl release` → watch K9 release itself (dry-run mode)

### Act 4: Lessons from Meta-Dogfooding (7 minutes)

**Three Critical Insights:**

**1. Validation Before Execution Is Non-Negotiable**
Every K9 component failed at least once during development. Having `must.check` run before any recipes saved hours of debugging half-executed workflows.

**Example:** Database migration contractile that forgot to check PostgreSQL was running. The `must.check` caught it before applying migrations.

**2. Security Levels Need Clear Boundaries**
`release-k9.k9.ncl` is yard-level (git writes, tests) but doesn't need hunt-level (system admin). The security model worked without being too restrictive.

Cryptographic signatures (Ed25519) for hunt-level prevent unauthorized escalation.

**3. Nickel Contracts Catch Configuration Errors Early**
```nickel
nickel = {
  config | {
    current_version | String,
    new_version | String,
    github_repo | String,
  } = {
    current_version = "0.9.0",
    new_version = "1.0.0",
    github_repo = "hyperpolymath/k9-svc",
  }
}
```

Forget to set `github_repo`? Nickel fails at parse time, not when `gh release create` runs.

**Meta-Dogfooding Reveals Edge Cases:**
- What happens when K9 validates itself? (Recursive checks)
- How do nested dependencies fail? (Error propagation clarity)
- Is the format too verbose for its own releases? (No—it's readable)

### Act 5: The K9 Ecosystem (3 minutes)

**Tooling Built:**
- **k9-init**: Scaffold contractiles from templates (8 templates: web-server, build, deploy, dev-env, ci-cd, backup, monitoring, minimal)
- **k9-validate**: Standalone validator (schema + dangerous pattern detection)
- **k9-sign**: Ed25519 signing for hunt-level contractiles
- **GitHub Action**: CI/CD integration for automated validation
- **VS Code Extension**: Syntax highlighting, live validation, go-to-definition

**Adoption:**
10 repos using K9 across the Hyperpolymath ecosystem:
- Dev environment setup
- Release automation (including K9 itself)
- Deployment workflows
- CI/CD pipelines

**Community:**
- Open source: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-svc (spec), https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-tools (tooling)
- License: PMPL-1.0 (Polymath Public Meta-License)
- Built with: Nickel, Rust, Justfile

### Conclusion: Why Meta-Dogfooding Matters (2 minutes)

**The Validation Pyramid:**
1. **Unit tests** - Do individual functions work?
2. **Integration tests** - Do components work together?
3. **Dogfooding** - Does the tool work for real use cases?
4. **Meta-dogfooding** - Can the tool automate itself?

If your automation tool can't automate itself, you've missed something fundamental about the abstraction.

**K9 proved its abstraction by releasing itself.** That's not just a demo—it's a validation technique that catches design flaws regular testing misses.

**Takeaway:** Next time you build a tool, ask: "Can this tool build/deploy/release itself?" If not, why not? The answer reveals gaps in your design.

**Call to Action:**
- Try K9: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-tools
- Read the spec: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-svc
- Join the meta-dogfooding movement

## Why Strange Loop?

Strange Loop celebrates the intersection of programming, infrastructure, and creative thinking about developer tools. This talk fits because:

1. **Developer Tools Focus**: K9 is infrastructure tooling built for developers
2. **Meta-Programming**: Self-referential systems (loops!) are core Strange Loop themes
3. **Practical Impact**: Attendees can use K9 immediately for real projects
4. **Interesting Constraint**: Meta-dogfooding as a validation technique is novel
5. **Cross-Cutting**: Touches DevOps, formal methods (Nickel contracts), cryptography (Ed25519), UX design

Strange Loop audiences appreciate tools that make you think differently about problems. K9 makes you reconsider what "validation" means for infrastructure automation.
