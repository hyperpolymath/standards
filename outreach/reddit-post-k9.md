# Reddit Post: K9 Meta-Dogfooding

## Title
I built an infrastructure automation tool, then made it release itself. Meta-dogfooding is wild.

## Post Body (r/programming)

**TL;DR:** K9 is a self-validating infrastructure framework. It released its own v1.0.0 using a K9 component. Meta-dogfooding reveals design flaws regular dogfooding misses.

Hey r/programming,

I've been working on K9, a framework for infrastructure automation. After using it for 10 projects, I had a realization: **K9 should release itself using K9**.

**What is K9?**

K9 components (`.k9.ncl` files) have three parts:

1. **must** (Bash) - Validates prerequisites
2. **just** (Justfile) - Execution recipes
3. **nickel** (Nickel contracts) - Config schema

Example:

```nickel
{
  must = {
    check = ''
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      command -v docker &> /dev/null
    '',
  },

  just = {
    recipes = {
      deploy = {
        commands = ["docker-compose up -d"],
      },
    },
  },

  nickel = {
    config = { port = 8080 },
  },
}
```

Before `just deploy` runs, `must.check` validates Docker is installed. Fail fast if not.

**The Meta-Dogfooding Twist:**

I created `release-k9.k9.ncl`—a K9 component that releases K9:

```nickel
{
  must = {
    check = ''
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      command -v git &> /dev/null || exit 1
      command -v gh &> /dev/null || exit 1
      git diff --quiet || exit 1  # No uncommitted changes
    '',
  },

  just = {
    recipes = {
      "bump-version" = {
        commands = ["sed -i 's/version = \"0.9.0\"/version = \"1.0.0\"/' Cargo.toml"],
      },

      release = {
        dependencies = ["bump-version", "test"],
        commands = [
          "git commit -m 'chore: bump version'",
          "git tag v1.0.0",
          "git push origin main --tags",
          "gh release create v1.0.0 --generate-notes",
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

**What This Proved:**

When `release-k9.k9.ncl` successfully released K9 v1.0.0, it validated:

1. **Self-validation works** - Caught uncommitted changes, missing tools
2. **Recipe dependencies work** - `release` waited for `bump-version` and `test`
3. **The abstraction works** - If K9 can release itself, it handles complex workflows

**Why Meta-Dogfooding Matters:**

Regular dogfooding: "I use K9 for deployments, it works."

Meta-dogfooding: "K9 automates its own releases, revealing edge cases I'd never find manually."

Examples:
- What happens when K9 validates itself? (Recursion checks)
- How do nested dependencies fail? (Error propagation)
- Is the format too verbose? (Nope—readable even for complex workflows)

**Three Lessons Learned:**

**1. Validation Before Execution Is Critical**

Every K9 component failed at least once during dev. `must.check` running *before* recipes saved hours of debugging half-executed workflows.

**2. Security Levels Need Clear Boundaries**

K9 has three levels (dog metaphors):
- **Kennel** (read-only): ls, cat, stat
- **Yard** (moderate): file writes, git ops
- **Hunt** (full access): requires Ed25519 signatures

`release-k9.k9.ncl` is yard-level. The boundaries worked without being restrictive.

**3. Config Errors Should Fail at Parse Time**

Nickel contracts validate config *before* execution:

```nickel
nickel = {
  config | {
    current_version | String,
    github_repo | String,
  } = ...
}
```

Forget `github_repo`? Fail at parse, not mid-release.

**Tools Built:**

- **k9-init**: Scaffold components from templates (8 templates)
- **k9-validate**: Standalone validator + dangerous pattern detection
- **k9-sign**: Ed25519 signing for hunt-level components
- **GitHub Action**: CI/CD integration
- **VS Code Extension**: Syntax highlighting, validation

**Adoption:**

10 repos using K9 (dev setup, releases, deployments, CI/CD). Including K9 releasing itself.

**Try It:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-tools
cd k9-tools
make build
./src/k9-init/target/release/k9-init --template minimal
```

**The Bigger Question:**

If your automation tool can't automate itself, what does that say about the abstraction?

K9 proved it works by dogfooding itself. Not just using it—*releasing itself* with it.

Curious what r/programming thinks: Is meta-dogfooding a useful validation technique? What other tools could release themselves?

## Alternate Post Body (r/devops)

**TL;DR:** Self-validating infrastructure components with fail-fast prerequisite checks. Plus meta-dogfooding (the tool releases itself).

---

Hey r/devops,

**The Problem:**

How many times have you run a deployment script that fails 15 minutes in because AWS creds aren't configured?

Or a Terraform apply that errors halfway because kubectl isn't installed?

**The Solution (K9):**

K9 components validate prerequisites *before* execution. Fail fast, clear errors.

**Example:**

```nickel
{
  must = {
    check = ''
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      command -v kubectl &> /dev/null || exit 1
      kubectl cluster-info &> /dev/null || exit 1
      aws sts get-caller-identity &> /dev/null || exit 1
    '',
  },

  just = {
    recipes = {
      deploy = {
        commands = [
          "helm upgrade --install my-app ./chart",
          "kubectl rollout status deployment/my-app",
        ],
      },
    },
  },

  nickel = {
    config = {
      namespace = "production",
      replicas = 3,
    },
  },
}
```

Before `just deploy` runs, K9 checks:
- kubectl installed?
- kubectl connected to cluster?
- AWS creds valid?

If not, instant failure. No half-deployed state.

**Three Security Levels:**

- **Kennel** (read-only): Safe by default (ls, cat, stat)
- **Yard** (moderate): File writes, git, package installs
- **Hunt** (full access): Requires Ed25519 signatures

No accidental `sudo rm -rf /`. Hunt-level needs explicit signing.

**Meta-Dogfooding:**

Here's the fun part: K9 releases itself using a K9 component.

`release-k9.k9.ncl` validates:
- git installed
- gh CLI installed
- No uncommitted changes
- On main branch

Then:
- Bumps version
- Runs tests
- Creates tag
- Pushes to GitHub
- Creates release

**All automated. All validated. All using K9 itself.**

**Lessons from Production Use:**

1. **Fail fast saves hours** - Half-executed deployments are the worst
2. **Config schemas matter** - Nickel catches typos at parse time
3. **Recipe dependencies work** - `deploy` depends on `test`, K9 enforces order

**Tooling:**

- **k9-init**: Scaffold from templates (web-server, build, deploy, ci-cd, backup, monitoring)
- **k9-validate**: CI integration for PR checks
- **k9-sign**: Cryptographic signing for privileged operations
- **GitHub Action**: Auto-validate on push
- **VS Code Extension**: Live validation in editor

**Real-World Use:**

10 repos (including K9 itself):
- Rust/Node/Go build setups
- Docker/Kubernetes deployments
- Database migrations
- Backup automation
- Release pipelines

**Why Not Just Use X?**

| Tool | K9 Difference |
|------|---------------|
| Make/Justfile | K9 adds prerequisite validation + config schemas |
| Ansible | K9 is file-based, not state-based; general-purpose |
| Terraform | K9 is imperative, not declarative; broader scope |
| Bash scripts | K9 adds structure, validation, type-safe config |

**Try It:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-tools
cd k9-tools
make build
./src/k9-init/target/release/k9-init --template deploy
```

Questions welcome! I've been running this in production for 6 months (including releasing itself).

## Posting Strategy

**Best subreddits:**

| Subreddit | Post Version | Best Day/Time |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| r/programming | Main post (meta-dogfooding angle) | Tue-Thu, 9-11am EST |
| r/devops | DevOps focus (fail-fast validation) | Any weekday |
| r/rust | Tooling written in Rust | Any weekday |
| r/programming_horror | Humor angle ("tool releases itself") | Weekend |
| r/infrastructure | Infrastructure automation | Any weekday |

**Engagement tactics:**

- Share `release-k9.k9.ncl` file directly for "show code" requests
- Offer templates for specific use cases (AWS, GCP, Docker, K8s)
- Acknowledge when K9 is overkill (simple scripts don't need it)
- Link to real examples in production repos

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't claim K9 replaces everything (Ansible/Terraform have their place)
- Don't oversell security (Ed25519 is solid, but explain threat model)
- Don't ignore "why not X" questions (compare honestly)
- Don't dismiss "this is just shell scripts" (acknowledge, explain value-add)

**Follow-up content ideas:**

- "K9 in 5 minutes" video tutorial
- Live demo of `release-k9.k9.ncl` running
- Template library expansion (community contributions)
- Blog series: "Self-validating infrastructure patterns"

**Expected Pushback:**

- *"Why not just use Make?"* - Make doesn't validate prerequisites or provide config schemas
- *"This is overengineered"* - For simple tasks, yes. For complex workflows, no.
- *"Nickel has a tiny ecosystem"* - True, but contracts are worth it for config validation
- *"Dog metaphors are silly"* - Memorable beats generic. "Kennel/Yard/Hunt" > "Level 0/1/2"
