**Duration:** 10 minutes
**Purpose:** Demonstrate K9 releasing itself using release-k9.k9.ncl
**Audience:** Developers interested in infrastructure automation

---

## Setup (Before Demo)

**Requirements:**
```bash
# Verify tools installed
command -v git
command -v gh
command -v just
command -v nickel
```

**Repo state:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/hyperpolymath-repos/k9-svc
git status  # Clean working tree
git branch  # On main
git log -1  # Note current version
```

**Have ready:**
- Terminal with large font
- Browser tab: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-svc/releases
- release-k9.k9.ncl open in editor

---

## Act 1: Show the Contractile (2 minutes)

**Narration:**
"This is release-k9.k9.ncl—a K9 contractile that releases K9 itself. Let me walk through its three sections."

**Show code:**
```bash
cat release-k9.k9.ncl
```

**Point out (while scrolling):**

1. **must section:**
   ```nickel
   must = {
     check = ''
       #!/usr/bin/env bash
       command -v git &> /dev/null || exit 1
       command -v gh &> /dev/null || exit 1
       git diff --quiet || exit 1
     '',
   }
   ```
   "Before doing anything, K9 validates prerequisites: git installed, gh CLI installed, no uncommitted changes."

2. **just section:**
   ```nickel
   just = {
     recipes = {
       "bump-version" = { ... },
       test = { ... },
       release = {
         dependencies = ["bump-version", "test"],
         commands = [
           "git commit -m 'chore: bump version'",
           "git tag v1.0.0",
           "git push origin main --tags",
           "gh release create v1.0.0 --generate-notes",
         ],
       },
     },
   }
   ```
   "Three recipes: bump-version, test, and release. Notice 'release' depends on the other two—K9 ensures they run first."

3. **nickel section:**
   ```nickel
   nickel = {
     config = {
       current_version = "0.9.0",
       new_version = "1.0.0",
       github_repo = "hyperpolymath/k9-svc",
     },
   }
   ```
   "Configuration with type contracts. If we forget 'github_repo', Nickel fails at parse time, not mid-release."

---

## Act 2: Validation Catches Errors (3 minutes)

**Narration:**
"Let's see what happens when prerequisites aren't met. First, I'll intentionally break something."

**Create uncommitted change:**
```bash
echo "# Test change" >> README.adoc
git status
```

**Output shows:**
```
modified:   README.adoc
```

**Run must validation:**
```bash
just -f release-k9.k9.ncl must
```

**Expected output:**
```
✗ Prerequisite check failed
Error: Uncommitted changes detected
```

**Narration:**
"K9 caught it! The release didn't even start. Let's fix it."

**Revert change:**
```bash
git checkout README.adoc
git status  # Clean
```

**Narration:**
"Now let's simulate missing the gh CLI."

**Temporarily rename gh:**
```bash
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/gh /usr/local/bin/gh.bak
```

**Run validation again:**
```bash
just -f release-k9.k9.ncl must
```

**Expected output:**
```
✗ Prerequisite check failed
Error: gh command not found
```

**Narration:**
"Again, K9 stops before doing anything dangerous. This is fail-fast validation in action."

**Restore gh:**
```bash
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/gh.bak /usr/local/bin/gh
```

**Run validation successfully:**
```bash
just -f release-k9.k9.ncl must
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ All prerequisites met
```

---

## Act 3: The Release (Dry-Run) (4 minutes)

**Narration:**
"Prerequisites validated. Now let's do a dry-run release to see what K9 would do."

**Explain dry-run approach:**
"I'll modify the contractile temporarily to add '--dry-run' flags so we can see the execution flow without actually creating a release."

**Show modified release recipe:**
```nickel
release = {
  dependencies = ["bump-version", "test"],
  commands = [
    "git commit --dry-run -m 'chore: bump version to 1.0.0'",
    "echo '[DRY-RUN] Would create tag: v1.0.0'",
    "echo '[DRY-RUN] Would push to origin main --tags'",
    "echo '[DRY-RUN] Would run: gh release create v1.0.0'",
  ],
},
```

**Execute:**
```bash
just -f release-k9.k9.ncl release
```

**Expected output (narrate as it runs):**
```
==> Running recipe: bump-version
sed -i 's/version = "0.9.0"/version = "1.0.0"/' Cargo.toml
git add Cargo.toml
✓ Version bumped to 1.0.0

==> Running recipe: test
cargo test --all
   Compiling k9-tools...
   Running tests...
✓ All tests passed

==> Running recipe: release
[DRY-RUN] Would create commit: chore: bump version to 1.0.0
[DRY-RUN] Would create tag: v1.0.0
[DRY-RUN] Would push to origin main --tags
[DRY-RUN] Would run: gh release create v1.0.0

✓ Release complete
```

**Narration during output:**
1. "First, bump-version runs—updates Cargo.toml"
2. "Then tests run—K9 won't release broken code"
3. "Finally, release runs—commit, tag, push, GitHub release"
4. "Notice the dependency order: bump → test → release. K9 enforces this automatically."

**Revert Cargo.toml:**
```bash
git checkout Cargo.toml
```

---

## Act 4: Show Real Release Artifacts (1 minute)

**Narration:**
"This isn't just a demo. K9 v1.0.0 was actually released using this exact contractile."

**Open browser to GitHub releases:**
https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-svc/releases/tag/v1.0.0

**Point out:**
- Release notes (auto-generated by gh)
- Tag created by release-k9.k9.ncl
- Commit message: "chore: bump version to 1.0.0"

**Show git log:**
```bash
git log --oneline -5
```

**Point to release commit:**
```
abc1234 chore: bump version to 1.0.0
```

**Narration:**
"This commit was created by K9 releasing itself. Meta-dogfooding in action."

---

## Conclusion (1 minute)

**Summary points:**

1. **Self-validation works**: must.check caught missing tools, uncommitted changes
2. **Dependencies work**: Recipes ran in order (bump → test → release)
3. **The abstraction works**: If K9 can release itself, it can handle complex workflows

**Call to action:**
"K9 is open source. Try it for your projects:"
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-tools
cd k9-tools
make build
./src/k9-init/target/release/k9-init --template minimal
```

**Final thought:**
"If your automation tool can't automate itself, what does that say about the abstraction? K9 proves it works by dogfooding itself—all the way to releases."

---

## Troubleshooting

**If validation fails unexpectedly:**
- Check `git status` for uncommitted changes
- Verify gh CLI authenticated: `gh auth status`
- Ensure on main branch: `git branch --show-current`

**If tests fail:**
- May need to skip test step in demo (focus on validation + release flow)
- Alternative: Use a minimal contractile example instead

**If dry-run modification is too complex:**
- Just explain what would happen instead of running
- Show GitHub release page as proof it worked

---

## Variants

**Short version (5 min):**
- Skip Act 2 (error demonstrations)
- Show contractile → run must → show release artifacts

**Extended version (15 min):**
- Add Act 5: Live k9-init demo (scaffold new contractile)
- Add Act 6: Show k9-validate catching dangerous patterns (rm -rf /)

**Interactive workshop version:**
- Attendees run their own k9-init
- Create a simple contractile together
- Have them validate it with k9-validate
