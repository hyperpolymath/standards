= IANA Media Type Registration: application/meta+scheme
:toc: left
:sectnums:

== Overview

This document contains the media type registration template for the META
format, intended for submission to IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).

== Registration Template

=== Type Name

`application`

=== Subtype Name

`meta+scheme`

=== Required Parameters

None.

=== Optional Parameters

==== charset

The `charset` parameter MAY be used to specify the character encoding.

* Default: `UTF-8`
* Allowed values: `UTF-8` (other encodings are not supported)

Example: `application/meta+scheme; charset=UTF-8`

==== version

The `version` parameter MAY be used to specify the META format version.

* Format: Semantic version string (e.g., `1.0`, `1.0.0`)
* Default: Implementation-dependent (typically latest supported)

Example: `application/meta+scheme; version=1.0`

=== Encoding Considerations

8bit. META files are UTF-8 encoded text files. They contain no binary
data and are safe for text-based transport mechanisms.

=== Security Considerations

META files are pure data files containing project metadata, architecture
decisions, and development practices. They pose minimal security risk
when processed as intended:

1. **No Code Execution**: META files MUST NOT be evaluated as Scheme code.
   Implementations MUST parse them as data structures only.

2. **Path Traversal**: If META files reference file paths, implementations
   SHOULD validate paths against expected locations.

3. **Information Disclosure**: META files may contain internal architecture
   details. Consider access controls for sensitive projects.

4. **Denial of Service**: Implementations SHOULD limit recursion depth and
   string lengths to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

5. **Injection Attacks**: When META data is used to generate other formats
   (HTML, SQL, shell commands), standard escaping and validation applies.

For comprehensive security guidance, see the Security Considerations
section of the META Format Specification.

=== Interoperability Considerations

1. **Scheme Dialect**: META files use a subset of R7RS Scheme syntax.
   Not all Scheme readers will correctly parse META files due to
   keyword syntax (`#:keyword`) which varies between implementations.

2. **Line Endings**: Implementations MUST accept both LF and CRLF.
   Implementations SHOULD normalize to LF when writing.

3. **JSON Binding**: A JSON binding is defined for environments without
   Scheme support. The JSON representation uses the media type
   `application/meta+json`.

4. **Extension Sections**: Implementations MAY encounter unknown sections.
   Unknown sections MUST be preserved when round-tripping.

=== Published Specification

META Format Specification, Version 1.0.0
https://github.com/hyperpolymath/META.scm/blob/main/spec/META-FORMAT-SPEC.adoc

(URL to be updated upon RFC publication)

=== Applications Which Use This Media Type

* Software development documentation tools
* Architecture decision record (ADR) management
* Project metadata aggregation systems
* Software bill of materials (SBOM) generators
* Development environment configuration

=== Fragment Identifier Considerations

Fragment identifiers MAY be used to reference specific sections or entries:

----
file.meta.scm#architecture-decisions
file.meta.scm#adr-001
file.meta.scm#development-practices.testing
----

Fragment syntax:

* `#section-name` — References a top-level section
* `#adr-NNN` — References a specific ADR by ID
* `#section.subsection` — Dot-notation for nested access

=== Additional Information

==== Deprecated Alias Names for This Type

None.

==== Magic Number(s)

META files typically begin with:

* `;;` (Scheme comment)
* `(define-module` (module declaration)

No formal magic number is defined.

==== File Extension(s)

* `.scm` — Shared with general Scheme files
* `META.scm` — Conventional filename for primary project metadata

==== Macintosh File Type Code(s)

None.

==== Object Identifier(s) or OID(s)

None.

== Alternative Media Types

=== application/meta+json

For the JSON binding of META format:

----
Type name:               application
Subtype name:            meta+json
Required parameters:     None
Optional parameters:     version
Encoding considerations: 8bit (UTF-8)
Security considerations: Same as application/meta+scheme
Published specification: META Format Specification, Appendix B
----

=== text/x-meta-scheme (Provisional)

For transitional use before formal registration:

----
Type name:               text
Subtype name:            x-meta-scheme
----

Note: The `text/` tree is discouraged for structured data formats.
`application/meta+scheme` is preferred.


== Registration Process

=== Step 1: Provisional Registration

Submit to IANA provisional registry:

1. Complete this template
2. Email to iana@iana.org with subject "Media Type Registration: application/meta+scheme"
3. Include link to published specification
4. Await confirmation (typically 2-4 weeks)

=== Step 2: Community Review

After provisional registration:

1. Announce on relevant mailing lists
2. Gather implementation experience
3. Address any feedback

=== Step 3: Permanent Registration

Requirements for permanent registration:

1. Specification published as RFC (Informational or Standards Track)
2. Demonstrated interoperability (multiple implementations)
3. No unresolved objections

Timeline: Typically concurrent with RFC publication.
