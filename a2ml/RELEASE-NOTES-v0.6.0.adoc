== Summary

v0.6.0 hardens the Module 0 prototype and documentation: directive parsing is
more precise, references are validated consistently, opaque payloads preserve
raw content, and the vector suite is aligned and passing end-to-end.

== Highlights

* Directive headers require a trailing `:` and parse attributes reliably
* `@refs` parses one paragraph per non-blank line
* `@opaque` preserves raw payload bytes through parsing and rendering
* Vector suite passes with updated expectations
* ReScript prototype cleaned for v12 (JSON.Encode, JsError, esmodule)
* CLI docs updated with exit codes and multi-file usage

== Documents

* `SPEC.adoc`
* `docs/GRAMMAR.adoc`
* `docs/CONFORMANCE.adoc`
* `docs/CLI.adoc`
