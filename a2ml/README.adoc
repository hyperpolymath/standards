= A2ML (Attested Markup Language)
:toc: preamble
:toclevels: 2
:icons: font

A2ML is a lightweight, Djot-like markup that compiles into a typed, attested core.
It keeps authoring simple while allowing strong structural guarantees when you
want them.

This repository is a satellite of the Hyperpolymath standards hub.

== What It Does

* Author a readable surface format with strict, typed guarantees when needed.
* Validate structure (IDs, refs, required sections) with progressive modes.
* Preserve opaque payloads byte-for-byte for reliable embedding.

== Where It Is Going

* Broader tooling integration (CLI, LSP, renderers).
* More profiles for domain-specific validation.
* Stronger proof coverage and conformance automation.

== Why A2ML

* Lightweight authoring with progressive strictness (lax -> checked -> attested)
* Strong guarantees: required sections, resolved references, unique IDs
* Opaque payloads preserved byte-for-byte for absolute fidelity
* Renderer portability across HTML/Markdown/PDF pipelines
