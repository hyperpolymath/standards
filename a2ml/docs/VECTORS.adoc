= Vector Runner (Prototype)

This is a minimal ReScript-based vector runner for Module 0 parsing and
rendering checks.

== What it does

* Parses `tests/vectors/*.a2ml`
* Checks error expectations from `*.expected`
* Optionally compares HTML output against `*.html.expected`
* Emits `build/vector-report.json` via `just vectors-report`

== Run

[source,bash]
----
just vectors
just vectors-report
----

== Notes

The `just vectors` recipe will run `rescript build -with-deps` before executing
the runner. It uses `deno` if available (via `prototype/rescript/deno.json`),
otherwise falls back to `node`.

The vector runner is intentionally small and should be replaced by a full
conformance harness in v0.3+.
