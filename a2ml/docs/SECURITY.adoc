= A2ML Security Brief

== Purpose

Reduce document-originated risks by making document behavior explicit,
verified, and non-executable by default.

== What A2ML Improves

* No implicit execution: embedded content treated as data
* Attested structure: invariants verified before rendering
* Explicit trust boundaries: opaque payloads remain opaque

== Known Pain Points Addressed

* Macro and embedded script risks in other formats
* Toolchain ambiguity and inconsistent interpretation
* Supply-chain doc tooling that silently alters content

== Economic and Compute Impact

* Lower security audit cost for documentation pipelines
* Shift checks to compile time, reducing runtime risk
* Simplified compliance for regulated documents
