= A2ML Session Summary (2026-01-26)

This summary captures the key decisions, artifacts, and direction established
in the initial A2ML planning session.

== Naming

* Name chosen: *A2ML* (Attested Markup Language)
* Rationale: compact, memorable, implies attestation; future-proof to A3ML, etc.

== Positioning

* Lightweight surface syntax with a typed, attested core
* Progressive strictness: lax -> checked -> attested
* Not a semantic-web ontology; focuses on document-internal guarantees

== Surface Syntax

* Djot-adjacent, minimal Module 0 for adoption
* Modular opt-in features (refs, figures, attributes, constraints, footnotes)
* Opaque payloads preserved byte-for-byte

== Typed Core

* Idris2 core model with proof obligations
* Invariants: unique IDs, resolved references, required sections

== Web Rendering

* Build-time, server-side, or client-side rendering supported
* ReScript parser/renderer prototype
* ReScript + WASM prototype using rescript-wasm-runtime

== Standards & Ecosystem

* A2ML registered as a satellite of hyperpolymath/standards
* Related satellites: k9-svc and stateful-artefacts-for-gitforges
* IANA media type draft prepared (vendor tree: application/vnd.a2ml)

== Published Artifacts

* SPEC.adoc, docs/GRAMMAR.adoc, docs/CONFORMANCE.adoc
* Module 0 quickstart + FAQ
* Comparison matrix + dependability/security/interop briefs
* Release notes (v0.1.0)
* GitHub Pages landing page (docs/index.html)

== Open Questions

* Finalize surface grammar vs Djot compatibility boundaries
* Decide formal core representation in Idris2
* Define canonical hash / attestation metadata
* Decide on reference implementation language and packaging
