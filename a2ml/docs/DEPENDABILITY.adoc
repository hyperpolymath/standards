= A2ML Dependability Brief

== Purpose

Make documents reliably correct over time by enforcing structural invariants
and validating references at compile time.

== What A2ML Improves

* Structural correctness: required sections exist, duplicate IDs prevented
* Reference integrity: all internal refs resolve
* Predictable rendering: typed core reduces output variability

== Known Pain Points Addressed

* Doc drift from manual updates
* Silent failures (broken refs, missing sections)
* Rework cycles caused by late discovery of errors

== Economic and Compute Impact

* Fewer review cycles and fewer late-stage fixes
* Lower maintenance costs for long-lived docs
* Reduced CI churn from invalid documents
