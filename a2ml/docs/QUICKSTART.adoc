= Module 0 Quickstart

A2ML Module 0 is intentionally tiny. It gives you readable markup plus a path
to stronger guarantees later.

== Example

[source,a2ml]
----
# A2ML Overview

@abstract:
A2ML is a typed, attested markup format. It verifies structure and references.
@end

## Claims
- Required sections must exist.
- References must resolve.

@refs:
[1] Attested Markup Language Spec (draft)
@end

== Opaque Blocks (Verbatim Content)

Use `@opaque` to embed any language or data exactly as-is.

[source,a2ml]
----
@opaque(lang="python"):
```
def hello():
    print("Hello, world")
```
@end
----

== Why This Matters

A2ML keeps writing simple while giving you a path to stronger guarantees.
Start with plain markup; later you can enable checks for missing sections,
broken references, or domain-specific rules without changing the document style.

== FAQ

Q: Is this just Markdown?
A: No. It is Markdown-friendly, but can compile into a typed core with
   guarantees when you enable higher modes.

Q: Do I need Idris to write it?
A: No. Idris is the verification backend; authors just write A2ML text.

Q: Will this break existing workflows?
A: No. You can render A2ML to Markdown/HTML and adopt it gradually.

Q: Can I embed arbitrary code or data?
A: Yes. `@opaque` blocks preserve content byte-for-byte.
