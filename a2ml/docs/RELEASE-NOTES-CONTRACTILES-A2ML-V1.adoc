== Summary

Contractiles A2ML v1 defines a stable, non-executable profile for the Contractiles
four-file model and ships validation and emission tooling with fixtures and CI.

== Highlights

* v1 spec and JSON emission schema.
* Validator/emitter tool with type overrides.
* Positive and negative fixtures with deterministic expected JSON.
* CI workflow for contractiles A2ML tests.
* Profile guidance: validation-only, no execution.

== Notes

This release formalizes A2ML profiles as validation-only. Any execution or side
effects are out of scope and must be gated by separate tooling.
