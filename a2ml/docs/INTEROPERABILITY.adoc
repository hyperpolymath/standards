= A2ML Interoperability Brief

== Purpose

Enable consistent rendering and validation across tools by using a shared
typed core and stable semantics.

== What A2ML Improves

* Semantic consistency across renderers
* Renderer portability across HTML/Markdown/PDF targets
* Cross-tool interoperability without tool-specific extensions

== Known Pain Points Addressed

* Markup fragmentation across platforms
* Tool-specific extensions leading to lock-in
* Lossy conversions between formats

== Economic and Compute Impact

* Lower migration costs between toolchains
* Reduced need for parallel doc formats
* Fewer renderer-specific bugs and manual fixes
