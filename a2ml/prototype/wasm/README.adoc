= A2ML WASM Prototype (ReScript + rescript-wasm-runtime)

This prototype demonstrates a direct-to-WASM flow using the
`rescript-wasm-runtime` project at `/var/mnt/eclipse/repos/rescript-wasm-runtime`.

== What it shows

* Compile a `.wat` file to `.wasm` via `Wasm.compileToWasm`
* Load and call a WASM export via `Wasm.loadModule`

== Files

* `fixtures/add.wat` - tiny WASM text module
* `src/WasmDemo.res` - demo using the runtime

== Notes

This is a minimal sketch. To run it locally, you need:

* `wat2wasm` (from WABT) on your PATH
* A JS runtime compatible with the runtime (Deno recommended)
* Access to `rescript-wasm-runtime` on your module path

== Suggested local setup

1. Work in a repo where `rescript-wasm-runtime` is already built.
2. Ensure `rescript.json` includes the module path or bundle output.
3. Run the generated JS in Deno.
