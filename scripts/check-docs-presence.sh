# check-docs-presence.sh — gate on core repository documentation.
#
# Replaces the `::warning::`-only "Check documentation" step in
# governance-reusable.yml, which could not fail over any input (standards#505).
#
# SPLIT GATE (wave8 doctrine: promote honestly, no manufactured red noise).
# Blast radius measured 2026-07-21 over the 412 real repo-root callers of
# governance-reusable in the local estate checkout:
#
#   README        0/412 missing  -> BLOCKING NOW. Arming reds nobody.
#   LICENSE       0/412 missing  -> BLOCKING NOW. Arming reds nobody.
#   CONTRIBUTING 54/412 missing  -> WARN until the cutoff, then BLOCKING.
#
# The CONTRIBUTING cutoff is a real date that flips itself. It is not a flag
# defaulting to off: on the cutoff date this check starts failing with no
# further edit to this file. That is the difference between a scheduled gate
# and theatre.
#
# Accepted filenames follow the estate documentation policy (AsciiDoc is the
# default; GitHub-required community-health files stay Markdown):
#   README.adoc | README.md
#   LICENSE | LICENSE.txt | LICENSE.md
#   CONTRIBUTING.md | CONTRIBUTING.adoc
#
# Usage: check-docs-presence.sh [repo-root]
#
# Environment (test seams — the shipped policy is the default in each case):
#   ENFORCE_CONTRIBUTING_FROM   YYYY-MM-DD; enforcement begins ON this date.
#   DOCS_TODAY                  YYYY-MM-DD; overrides "now" so the pre-cutoff
#                               and post-cutoff branches are both testable.
#
# Exit: 0 = pass (or in-grace warning), 1 = policy failure or bad configuration.
