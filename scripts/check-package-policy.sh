# check-package-policy.sh — gate on the Guix-primary packaging policy, applied
# only where the repo's rsr-profile declares reproducible-build or container.
#
# Replaces the echo-only "Enforce Guix primary / Nix fallback" step in
# governance-reusable.yml, whose every branch echoed and which terminated with
# an unconditional `✅ Package policy check passed` (standards#505). It could
# not detect a violation, and it claimed a pass over any input.
#
# POLICY — canonical source is `0-canon/rsr/
# 3-practice/LANGUAGE-POLICY.adoc` §Package Management, NOT CLAUDE.md:
#
#   RULED 2026-05-18 (estate-wide): Guix primary + sealed-container escape;
#   NO Nix mirror. One packager per repo. A `flake.nix` that only mirrors a
#   Guix manifest is drift to remove, not a fallback. A second packager is
#   permitted only where it is the *sole* source of a *specific named*
#   dependency, and that dependency is documented as the reason.
#   **Supersedes the prior "Nix fallback everywhere" rule.**
#
# Tiers: Guix (guix.scm/manifest.scm) is PRIMARY; a sealed container
# (Containerfile, Podman/Svalinn-sealed) is the ESCAPE HATCH for the
# not-in-Guix / non-free tail. Nix is NOT a tier.
#
# This script previously cited CLAUDE.md and printed
# `✅ Nix package management detected (fallback)`. CLAUDE.md's packaging
# section is STALE — it still describes Nix as a fallback, in 472 copies
# estate-wide — and CLAUDE.md itself defers to 3-practice/LANGUAGE-POLICY.adoc as
# canonical, so the .adoc wins. Blessing a flake as compliant is what let the
# 2026-07-21 remediation sweep ship `flake.nix` to 59 repos that should have
# received Guix or a container.
#
# It also had NO sealed-container detection at all, so the policy's own escape
# hatch could not satisfy the policy — a repo doing exactly the right thing for
# the not-in-Guix tail was reported as having no packaging.
#
# PREDICATE — deliberately tightened. The previous step accepted *any* `*.scm`
# anywhere in the tree as proof of "Guix package management detected", which a
# stray Guile source file satisfies without any packaging existing. This script
# requires a genuine packaging artefact (guix.scm / manifest.scm / channels.scm
# / .guix-channel) and prunes vendored trees so a dependency's file cannot
# satisfy the policy on the repo's behalf. Measured 2026-07-21 over the 412 real
# repo-root callers, tightening moved only 13 repos (57 -> 70 failing), so the
# honest predicate is nearly free.
#
# GRACE WINDOW: 70/412 callers (17%) currently satisfy neither. They warn until
# the cutoff, then fail. The cutoff is a real date that flips itself with no
# further edit to this file.
#
# NOTE ON LOCKFILES: the replaced step also grepped `git diff HEAD~1` for
# package-lock.json / yarn.lock / Gemfile.lock / Pipfile.lock / poetry.lock.
# That branch was inert — governance checks out at `ref: github.sha` without
# `fetch-depth: 0`, so `HEAD~1` does not resolve and the command was swallowed
# by `2>/dev/null` / `|| true`. It is dropped here rather than kept as a stub:
# the blocking rule for lockfiles is hypatia `cicd_rules/nodejs_detected`.
# Broadening that rule beyond package-lock.json is tracked as follow-up.
#
# Usage: check-package-policy.sh [repo-root]
#
# Environment (test seams — the shipped policy is the default in each case):
#   ENFORCE_PACKAGE_POLICY_FROM  YYYY-MM-DD; enforcement begins ON this date.
#   ENFORCE_NIX_RETIREMENT_FROM  YYYY-MM-DD; date Nix-only stops warning and
#                                starts failing. Owner-set: 2026-06-01.
#   PKG_TODAY                    YYYY-MM-DD; overrides "now" so the pre-cutoff
#                                and post-cutoff branches are both testable.
#
# Exit: 0 = pass (or in-grace warning), 1 = policy failure or bad configuration.
