# Staleness checker script for hyperpolymath estate repositories.
#
# Ensures consumer workflows do not use retired patterns or *genuinely* stale
# pins of the standards reusable workflows (governance / hypatia-scan /
# scorecard).
#
# ── Why this is a *window*, not an exact-HEAD match ─────────────────────────
# `standards` hosts reusable workflows that consumer repos pin by full SHA.
# The original gate failed a consumer whenever its pin != standards HEAD. That
# turned every standards commit into a fleet-wide red: HEAD can move several
# times an hour, and each move forced a manual pin bump in every consumer
# (observed live in stapeln — 5a93d9d→d72fe5a→4ddc926 in ~30 min, three
# forced 3-file bumps). The gate became a treadmill instead of a guard.
#
# The fix mirrors the estate's existing staleness idiom (Hypatia HYP-S006
# `registry-staleness`, which tolerates drift for `stale_after_days` before it
# escalates): a pin PASSES if it is a genuine ancestor of standards HEAD that
# is *within a recency window* — at most STALENESS_WINDOW_COMMITS commits
# behind HEAD, OR at most STALENESS_WINDOW_DAYS days old (union; either
# qualifies).
#
# ── Why age alone no longer FAILS (2026-07-21) ──────────────────────────────
# The window was still a clock, just a slower one. standards moves ~2.6
# commits/day, so a consumer exhausts both budgets ~14 days after any
# propagation — measured: 294 of 350 consumers red on the single pin d7c22711,
# every one of them green a fortnight earlier, with nothing changed in any
# consumer. Keeping the fleet green would have meant re-pinning ~300 repos
# every fortnight (~7,800 PRs/year). A gate that fails everyone on a timer is
# not a guard; it trains the estate to ignore it, and it buries the findings
# that matter.
#
# So the gate now fails on facts about the pin, never on its age:
#   * KNOWN_BAD_BEFORE — the pin predates the fix for a *named* defect. This is
#     the honest expression of what the window was proxying for, and it is
#     strictly better in both directions: a recent pin carrying the defect is
#     still caught, and an old pin carrying none is not punished by the
#     calendar. The pre-cache-fix Hypatia scanner (#441) is the first entry.
#   * FORGED — the pin is not a commit of this repository reachable from the
#     default branch, confirmed server-side (supply-chain integrity).
#   * the two structural rules (retired scorecard-enforcer; direct consumer
#     Scorecard SARIF publication outside the canonical reusable).
# Age outside the window is reported as a ::notice for the propagation path to
# act on.
#
# Deliberately jumping a consumer to HEAD (e.g. to pick up a fix early) is the
# job of the propagation path — `scripts/propagate-workflow-pins.sh` plus the
# Hypatia `sha_bump_propagation` rule + gitbot-fleet — which opens an
# audit-first bump PR. See
# docs/decisions/ADR-003-workflow-pin-staleness-window.adoc.
#
# Environment knobs (all optional):
#   STALENESS_EXPECTED_SHA    — override the "current" standards HEAD SHA.
#   STALENESS_STANDARDS_DIR   — path to a git checkout carrying standards
#                               history (defaults to this script's own repo;
#                               in CI the governance reusable clones standards
#                               with `--filter=tree:0` so the full commit graph
#                               is available for ancestry/age math).
#   STALENESS_WINDOW_COMMITS  — max commits-behind-HEAD a pin may be (default 50).
#   STALENESS_WINDOW_DAYS     — max age in days a pin may be (default 14, matching
#                               HYP-S006 stale_after_days). Advisory since
#                               2026-07-21: exceeding it emits a notice, not an
#                               error.
#   STALENESS_STANDARDS_NWO   — owner/repo a pin must belong to, used for the
#                               server-side integrity check (default
#                               hyperpolymath/standards).
#   STALENESS_STANDARDS_BRANCH— branch a pin must be reachable from (default main).
#   STALENESS_API_BASE        — API root for the server-side integrity check
#                               (default https://api.github.com; set for GHES,
#                               or to an unreachable host in tests).
#   STALENESS_KNOWN_BAD_BEFORE— override the known-bad deny-list, as space- or
#                               comma-separated <reusable>:<fix-sha> entries.
#                               "-" disables it. For the hermetic fixture tests
#                               and downstream forks.
