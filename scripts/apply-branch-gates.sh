# apply-branch-gates.sh — fill the `required_status_checks` rule of a
# repository's active branch ruleset with contexts DERIVED from what its
# default-branch runs actually emitted.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   config/rulesets/README.adoc has said so outright since it was written:
#   "the propagation mechanism is still missing by design, and this note is the
#   reminder that a template fix without an applier is a half fix." Nothing in
#   this repository read config/rulesets/gates.json as DATA — every reference
#   was prose, or tests/test_governance_reusable_shape.sh asserting the file's
#   contents. gates.json specified a derivation that no code performed.
#   apply-tag-ruleset-canon.sh is the TAG applier; this is its branch sibling.
#
# CONTEXTS ARE DERIVED, NEVER TYPED
#   config/rulesets/gates.json: "Contexts are never typed by hand." A typed
#   context that nothing emits is a PHANTOM — it can never turn green, so it
#   blocks the branch forever. This script therefore reads the check names the
#   latest default-branch run of each gate workflow ACTUALLY produced:
#     GET /repos/{o}/{r}/actions/workflows/{file}/runs?branch=<default>&per_page=1
#     GET /repos/{o}/{r}/actions/runs/{id}/jobs
#   and uses the job `name` verbatim. For a reusable caller GitHub already
#   renders that as "<caller job id> / <reusable job name>".
#
# THE TWO REFUSALS THAT MATTER
#   if_no_run_yet            -> omit that file's contexts and REPORT it.
#                               Never write a context nothing has emitted.
#   if_zero_contexts_overall -> do NOT write the rule at all; report UNGATED.
#                               A required_status_checks rule with an empty list
#                               is a VACUOUS GATE: it reports "protected" while
#                               requiring nothing. That is worse than no rule,
#                               because it is indistinguishable from a real one
#                               in every summary view.
#
# EXACTNESS GUARD
#   A ruleset PUT REPLACES the whole object. This script therefore refuses to
#   write unless the planned body, normalised over the required_status_checks
#   rule alone, is byte-identical to the source. Anything else moved => refuse.
#   Without this, one jq slip silently strips required_signatures estate-wide.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
#   * It never CREATES a ruleset unless --create-gates is passed, and then only
#     from the committed canon body (--gates-only-file, guarded for shape).
#     Without the flag a repo with no repo-level branch ruleset is reported
#     NORULESET or ORG-INHERITED. Creating branch protection where none exists
#     is a policy act, not a gate-fill; owner decision O6 (standards#787 row
#     D17) IS that policy, so creating THAT ONE body implements a ruling.
#   * It never DELETES or rewrites another rule. Repos carrying the retired
#     types (update, required_deployments, code_quality, code_coverage) are
#     REPORTED, not repaired: the estate census was ruled report-only. Pass
#     --strip-retired to opt in, one repo at a time.
#   * It never emits a retired rule type itself. The exactness guard makes that
#     structurally impossible, not merely intended.
#   * Two active REPO-LEVEL branch rulesets are resolved BY SHAPE, and only by
#     shape: the gates ruleset is the one whose only rule is
#     required_status_checks. That pair is the EXPECTED O6 steady state, so a
#     flat refusal would make the applier unable to maintain the very shape the
#     ruling prescribes. If shape does not single one out => AMBIGUOUS, fail
#     closed. Rulesets are ADDITIVE (see apply-tag-ruleset-canon.sh): writing
#     one of a pair leaves the other enforcing, and the repo stays blocked by a
#     rule nothing announced. Guessing which to fill is how that happens
#     silently -- and NAME never discriminates, as the tag applier proved with
#     372 blocked repos and 26 healthy ones sharing one name.
#   * It never tries to write an ORG-INHERITED ruleset. repos/{r}/rulesets
#     RETURNS the org's rulesets alongside the repo's own, and one of them is
#     readable IN FULL at repos/{r}/rulesets/{id} -- so every read succeeds and
#     nothing warns you. The PUT to that same path 404s. That was measured 67
#     times, once for every metadatastician repo reached by the org-level
#     EstateBranching (18225024). The cure for an inherited ruleset is at
#     /orgs/{org}/rulesets/{id}, applied ONCE, not per repo -- so this script
#     reports ORG-INHERITED and stops rather than issuing 67 doomed writes.
#     The discriminator is .source_type, which the LIST endpoint does return
#     (verified against the live API: every entry carries it). An entry WITHOUT
#     it is reported UNKNOWN, never assumed repo-level: writability is exactly
#     what that field decides, and guessing it wrong is a silent 404.
#     ⚠ --create-gates does NOT change that: an org-inherited ruleset is still
#     never written. It creates a SECOND, repo-level checks-only ruleset beside
#     it, which is what O6 prescribes -- filling the inherited one would be a
#     fake gate regardless of writability, because bypass binds a RULESET.
#
# Inputs (environment):
#   GH_TOKEN       required for writes; needs administration:write on targets.
#   ESTATE_ORGS    optional, space-separated. Default "metadatastician".
#
# Flags:
#   --apply            perform writes. WITHOUT IT THIS SCRIPT ONLY REPORTS.
#   --repo OWNER/NAME  process exactly one repository (repeatable).
#   --limit N          process at most N repositories (pilot runs).
#   --gates-file F     default config/rulesets/gates.json
#   --strip-retired    also remove the 4 retired rule types. Off by default.
#   --require-green N  drop any derived context that is not green across the
#                      last N default-branch runs of its workflow, and REFUSE
#                      the repo outright if any of those runs cannot be read.
#                      Off (0) by
#                      default. Owner ruling on #956: "require the reliably-
#                      green set" -- a required context that is currently red
#                      blocks the branch the moment it is required, so gating
#                      on it converts a visible red into a merge deadlock.
#                      `skipped` and `neutral` COUNT AS GREEN: GitHub treats
#                      both as satisfying a required status check.
#   --skip-user        do not enumerate user/repos; use only ESTATE_ORGS.
#   --create-gates     when a repo has NO repo-level branch ruleset, CREATE the
#                      O6 checks-only one from --gates-only-file instead of
#                      reporting and stopping. Off by default: creating branch
#                      protection where none exists is a policy act. Owner
#                      decision O6 (standards#787 row D17) IS that policy and
#                      config/rulesets/gates-only.json is its committed body,
#                      so creating THAT ONE body implements a ruling rather
#                      than making one. The body is guarded for canon shape
#                      and this script fills its context list; it is never
#                      hand-written and never read from an arbitrary file.
#   --gates-only-file F  default config/rulesets/gates-only.json
#   --no-integration-bypass
#                      strip every Integration actor from the CREATED ruleset's
#                      bypass list, so the AI actors (claude, dependabot,
#                      github-actions, oikosbot) are genuinely bound by the
#                      gates from day one. Requires --create-gates: the update
#                      path may not touch bypass_actors at all (the exactness
#                      guard and the post-write DRIFT check both forbid it).
#                      ⚠ This DIVERGES from the committed canon body. It refuses
#                      to leave the bypass list empty -- a branch ruleset with
#                      zero bypass actors is the shape of the 2026-09-11 tag
#                      outage, and with require_code_owner_review upstream it
#                      would deadlock the repository outright.
