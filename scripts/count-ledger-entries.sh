# count-ledger-entries.sh — count exemption ENTRIES in a ledger read from stdin.
# Used by the exemption ratchet.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE. It was first embedded in the ratchet as an inline
# interpreter one-liner. The matching needs both `'''` and `"` for TOML's string
# forms, and passing that through a single-quoted shell argument mangled it. A
# `|| echo 0` fallback then swallowed the error, so the count silently became 0
# on both sides of the comparison and the ledger was skipped entirely — a check
# that reported OK while measuring nothing.
#
# ⚠ NO FALLBACK. If this cannot run, the ratchet must fail. A counter that
# returns 0 on error is indistinguishable from an empty ledger, and "empty" is
# the state that passes.
#
# WHY ENTRIES AND NOT LINES, for TOML. A non-comment line count for
# `.gitleaks.toml` counts `paths = [`, the closing `]`, and every structural
# line. Reformatting one array across several lines then reads as growth, while
# adding an entry to an existing single-line array reads as no change at all.
# Both directions are wrong, and the second is the dangerous one: it lets an
# exemption be added invisibly.
#
# ⚠ SHELL, NOT PYTHON OR A JS RUNTIME. Estate policy bans Python outright, and
# the JS runtime has already moved once (Deno to Bun). A counter the ratchet
# depends on must not be invalidated by the next runtime change. awk is present
# wherever the ratchet runs.
#
# ⚠ AN EXPLICIT SCANNER, NOT A REGEX. awk has no non-greedy matching, so the
# array body and each string form are walked character by character. That is
# also why a comment containing a quote, or a `]` inside a string, cannot end
# the array early — the cases a regex port would get wrong.
