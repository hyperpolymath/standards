# check-settings-drift.sh — detect estate settings moving without anyone noticing.
#
# ── The fault this catches ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Repository SETTINGS are not in git. Nothing reviews them, nothing diffs them,
# and a change leaves no artefact — no commit, no PR, no run. The estate is
# 97–100% compliant with `config/settings/repo.json` at any given moment, so
# re-applying the canon gains almost nothing. What is missing is anything that
# NOTICES when a setting moves.
#
# Measured 2026-09-14, the day this was written: the Actions allowlist on 239
# repositories changed from `allowed_actions=selected` with an EMPTY
# `patterns_allowed` and `verified_allowed=false`, to a 92-pattern allowlist
# with `verified_allowed=true` — between a census and the authorised write that
# was meant to fix it. The fix had already happened. Nobody could say when, by
# whom, or whether it was deliberate, because no instrument was watching.
# That is the whole argument for this script.
#
# ── Why an EMPTY allowlist is the highest-value check here ─────────────────
# An empty `patterns_allowed` refuses every third-party action, INCLUDING
# transitively through a reusable workflow, because actions are judged against
# the CALLER repo's allow-list. The run then dies at `startup_failure` with
# `jobs.total_count == 0` and emits NO check run — so a required context never
# reports and the repo looks GREENER than a healthy one. A settings change can
# therefore disarm CI estate-wide while every dashboard stays clean.
#
# ── Calibration: what a hit does and does not prove ────────────────────────
# A reported line means the live setting differs from canon. It does NOT prove
# anything is broken:
#   * `per_repo_deltas_allowed` keys are legitimately per-repo and are skipped.
#   * `security_and_analysis` is unavailable on private repos of a Free account;
#     canon itself carries `repo_private_overrides` for this. Skipped on private.
#   * An empty allowlist harms only repos that actually CALL a third-party
#     action. Measured 2026-09-14: of 61 such repos, 48 were genuinely broken
#     and 13 were CLEAR. This script reports the setting; it does not claim the
#     repo is dead.
# Conversely a CLEAN result is not proof CI is healthy — a startup failure can
# be EVENT-SPECIFIC and invisible in every setting and every file. Proven the
# same day: `sanctify-php` run 34768365915 (`push`, head a25c8edb) died with
# jobs=0, while run 34895780522 (`workflow_dispatch`, the SAME head a25c8edb)
# started 7 jobs and mirrored successfully. Identical bytes, identical settings.
#
# ── The subset rule (do not "fix" this into an equality check) ─────────────
# GitHub ECHOES BACK defaults it was never sent. Comparing canon to live by
# equality produces permanent false drift on keys nobody ever set. Every
# comparison here is CANON ⊆ LIVE, one key at a time. The same trap already
# cost two hard 422s when `config/rulesets/base.json` was PUT verbatim.
#
# ── What this is NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# It REPORTS ONLY. It never writes a setting. Unattended cross-repo mutation is
# a human decision, and settings are exactly where that matters most.
#
# Usage:  check-settings-drift.sh [--owner OWNER] [--canon PATH] [--limit N]
# Output: TSV — repo <TAB> key <TAB> expected <TAB> actual
# Exit:   0 = no drift   1 = drift found   2 = usage / environment error
