# check-launcher-standard-currency.sh -- fail if a repo claims compliance with a
# launcher standard filename or version that no longer exists upstream.
#
# standards#960 acceptance criterion 4.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# `launcher/launcher-standard.a2ml` was DELETED from `standards` on 2026-09-22
# (#952, be6c9580) and replaced by `launcher/launcher-standard_praxis.deed`.
# Nothing told the downstream repos. A census on 2026-09-22 found 21 distinct
# `*.launcher.a2ml` descriptors, plus `trigger/scripts/trigger-launcher.sh`,
# still declaring "Compliant with launcher-standard.a2ml v0.3.0" -- a filename
# that is gone and a version that no longer exists. Both claims read as
# compliance and neither is checkable, which is the vacuous-gate pattern the
# estate rules against.
#
# THE TWO DEFECTS ARE INDEPENDENT
# -------------------------------
# A reference fails on the FILENAME or on the VERSION, separately:
#
#   launcher-standard.a2ml           any version  -> FAIL (retired filename)
#   launcher-standard_praxis.deed    v0.3.0       -> FAIL (stale version)
#   launcher-standard.a2ml           v0.4.0       -> FAIL (filename only)
#   launcher-standard_praxis.deed    v0.4.0       -> PASS
#
# A reference carrying no version token is checked on the filename alone; that
# is not a defect in itself, because plenty of prose names the standard without
# pinning it.
#
# `launcher-standard.adoc` is a DIFFERENT document (the human-readable UX
# standard) and is deliberately NOT checked here. It declares no version of its
# own, so a version claim against it is a separate defect and belongs in its
# own gate rather than being smuggled into this one.
#
# ANTI-DRIFT: THE EXPECTED VERSION IS NOT A MAGIC NUMBER
# ------------------------------------------------------
# CURRENT_VERSION below is a default for consumer repos, which do not carry the
# standard. It is NOT the authority. `scripts/tests/` asserts that this default
# equals `:standard-version` in the real deed, so bumping the standard without
# updating this script turns `standards`' own CI red. A checker whose expected
# value can silently drift from the thing it checks is worse than no checker.
# Consumers that DO vendor the deed should pass `--standard <path>` and read the
# version from the artefact instead of trusting this default.
#
# HISTORICAL RECORDS ARE ALLOWLISTED BY PATH, NEVER BY CONTENT
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# standards#960 AC1 exempts "a dated historical record". That exemption is a
# PATH allowlist (see ALLOWLIST below), not a content heuristic: a heuristic
# that spares any line mentioning "formerly" or "translated from" would spare
# the live defect too, because that is exactly how a stale descriptor comment
# is worded.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  no defects
#   1  at least one defect
#   2  usage error, or a seeded mutant survived --self-test
