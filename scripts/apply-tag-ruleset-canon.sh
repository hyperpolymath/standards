# apply-tag-ruleset-canon.sh — converge every non-archived estate repository on
# the canonical immutable-tags ruleset (config/rulesets/immutable-tags.json).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   On 2026-09-11 a deployment wave wrote a tag ruleset carrying a `creation`
#   rule with ZERO bypass actors onto 372 repositories, which makes it
#   impossible to create ANY tag in those repositories. The damage persisted
#   because no committed script in this repository globs config/rulesets/ — so
#   nothing ever re-converged the estate. A one-shot sweep would have cured the
#   data and left that root cause intact. This applier IS the cure: it is the
#   invariant, not the repair.
#
# IDENTITY — READ BEFORE EDITING
#   Per config/README.adoc: "Identity is the target, never the name ... an
#   existing ruleset is PUT by id and keeps whatever name it has." A tag ruleset
#   is therefore identified as: target == "tag" AND
#   conditions.ref_name.include == ["~ALL"] exactly. The `name` field is NEVER
#   used to classify, and is sent ONLY on a POST that creates a new ruleset —
#   sending it on a PUT would silently rename the ruleset. Measured 2026-09-15:
#   372 repos named `Immutable-Tags` were BLOCKED, 26 with that SAME name were
#   not, 2 named `Immutable Tags` were healthy. The name is noise.
#
# RULESETS ARE ADDITIVE
#   Bypass is per-ruleset. A repository holding a healthy ruleset AND a
#   zero-bypass rival still refuses every tag (proven on awesome-gleam and
#   awesome-zig, which each hold two and both return HTTP 422). So "this repo
#   already has a good ruleset" is never grounds to skip it, and a duplicate
#   must be reconciled by DELETING the rival, not by correcting one of them.
#   config/README.adoc: "Exactly one such ruleset must exist; zero or two is a
#   verifier failure." Duplicates therefore FAIL CLOSED here and are reported;
#   deletion happens only under the explicit --reconcile-duplicates flag.
#
# Inputs (environment):
#   GH_TOKEN                 required. Must hold administration:write on every
#                            target repository. GITHUB_TOKEN from a workflow is
#                            repo-scoped and WILL NOT DO.
#   CANON_FILE               optional. Default config/rulesets/immutable-tags.json
#   ESTATE_ORGS              optional. Space-separated orgs to union in.
#                            Default "metadatastician".
#
# Inputs (flags):
#   --apply                  perform writes. WITHOUT IT THIS SCRIPT ONLY REPORTS.
#   --limit N                process at most N repositories (pilot runs).
#   --repo OWNER/NAME        process exactly one repository (repeatable).
#   --reconcile-duplicates   delete zero-bypass rival tag rulesets where a
#                            healthy sibling exists. Off by default.
#   --revive-disabled        allow a PUT to a ruleset whose enforcement is
#                            `disabled`, which RE-ENABLES it. Off by default:
#                            disabled is a deliberate human act, not drift.
#   --no-verify              skip the real-tag-ref verification probe.
#   --skip-user              do not enumerate user/repos; use only ESTATE_ORGS.
#                            An App installation token is scoped to ONE owner, so
#                            covering a user and an org needs one run per
#                            credential. This flag makes that composable.
#
# Outputs:
#   A TSV report on stdout: repo <TAB> state <TAB> detail
#   A one-line-per-class summary on stderr.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every target repository is CONVERGED (and verified, unless --no-verify)
#   2  drift remains, or one or more repositories FAILED
#   3  credential is absent or lacks administration:write (fails BEFORE any
#      sweep, so a missing secret can never present as a clean run)
#   4  a target repository needs a bypass actor whose GitHub App is not
#      installed on that owner. This is LOUD ON PURPOSE: falling back to an
#      admin-only body would re-create the two-variant canon this estate has
#      explicitly rejected.
#
# Dependencies: bash 4+, gh (authenticated), jq.

# resolves to an empty string in silence and the sweep writes nothing while
# reporting success.
# A credential probe must answer the question its CONSUMER asks -- "can I make
# authenticated API calls?" -- and `gh auth status` does NOT. MEASURED 2026-09-15
# 03:09Z: while this account was merely RATE-LIMITED, `gh auth status` reported
#   "X Failed to log in ... The token in ~/.config/gh/hosts.yml is invalid."
# and told the operator to re-authenticate. The token was perfectly valid. Trusting
# that verdict makes this script abort with a FATAL that is FALSE, and sends the
# operator to `gh auth login`, destroying a working credential to cure a condition
# that clears itself on the next reset. (`gh api rate_limit` is no help either: it
# is exempt from the limit and answered remaining=4999 while every other read 403'd.)
# So classify the probe THREE ways, on the response body, never on gh's own verdict:

FATAL: the credential is VALID but this account's API rate limit is EXHAUSTED.
Refusing to start: a sweep run now would book hundreds of repos as FAILED purely
because their reads 403'd, and that report would be indistinguishable from real
drift. Retry after the limit resets at: $reset_at
DO NOT run 'gh auth login' for this. The token is fine -- note that 'gh auth
status' MISREPORTS a rate-limited account as holding an invalid token, and
re-authenticating would throw away a working credential for no reason.

  ${COUNT[PLAN-EXCLUDED]} repo(s) are PLAN-EXCLUDED, NOT failed. Rulesets are a paid
  feature on a PRIVATE repository: a free-plan owner gets 403 "Upgrade to GitHub
  Pro or make this repository public" regardless of admin rights. These repos can
  NEVER converge on the current plan, so this run does not treat them as drift and
  does not fail because of them. To bring them to canon the OWNER must pick one of:
  upgrade the owning org/user plan, make the repo public, or transfer it to an
  owner on a paid plan. Until then they are a KNOWN, RECORDED exemption from canon.

  ================================================================
  A bypass actor's GitHub App is NOT INSTALLED on a target owner.
  GitHub refused the canonical body with:
      "Actor <app> integration must be part of the ruleset source
       or owner organization"
  This script DELIBERATELY does not fall back to an admin-only
  body. Doing so would silently produce a second, weaker canon on
  those repositories -- the two-variant estate this owner has
  explicitly rejected. ONE body everywhere is the decision.
  ACTION REQUIRED BY THE OWNER: install the App on that owner.
  Nobody else can do it; an API token cannot install an App.
