# check-manifest-ply-test.sh — assertions for scripts/check-manifest-ply.sh.
#
# The gate reads FILENAMES and DIRECTORY DEPTH only: no network, no git
# plumbing, no manifest parsing. So every case here is a real tree on disk with
# a real `.git` marker, and the classification is whatever the gate makes of it.
#
# Each fixture carries its OWN `.git`, because the gate resolves a manifest's
# frame by walking to the nearest ancestor containing `.git`. Without one the
# walk would escape the fixture and reparent the file onto whatever repo the
# temp dir happens to sit under — the test would then be measuring this
# machine's disk layout rather than the gate.
