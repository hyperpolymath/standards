# triage-2026-10-24-apply-test.sh — regression tests for
# scripts/triage-2026-10-24-apply.sh and the 2026-10-24 backlog classification.
#
# The script closes GitHub issues, so every test runs against a `gh` shim on
# PATH: nothing here touches the network, and a test failure cannot close an
# issue. What is asserted is exactly the contract the document claims:
#   * the CSV is complete (one row per open issue, unique, valid tiers);
#   * --report needs no network;
#   * dry-run writes nothing;
#   * --apply comments then closes every tier-C issue, and nothing else;
#   * an already-closed issue is skipped rather than re-commented.
