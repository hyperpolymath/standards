# Regression cover for scripts/check-action-pins-resolve.sh.
#
# An unresolvable `uses:` produces NO check run at all — the job silently never
# runs, so the board looks green while the gate is simply absent. This checker
# is what stands between the estate and that failure mode, which means its own
# behaviour has to be pinned down precisely.
#
# The interesting property is not "does it find bad pins" but the DISTINCTION it
# draws between a determinate negative and an indeterminate answer:
#
#   404/422 from the commits endpoint  -> determinate; re-probe to say WHICH
#                                         thing is missing; counts as failure
#   403 / 5xx / network error          -> says NOTHING about the pin; must be
#                                         reported and must NOT fail the build
#
# Get that backwards in either direction and the tool is worthless: fail-closed
# on a rate limit and every consumer reddens for reasons unrelated to its code;
# fail-open silently and a genuinely dead pin sails through. It fails OPEN but
# ANNOUNCES itself, and this suite exists to hold it to that.
#
# The network is driven by a `curl` stub placed ahead of the real binary on
# PATH, keyed on the URL, so every branch is reachable offline and repeatably.
