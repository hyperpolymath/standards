# WHAT THIS PINS, AND WHY A PASSING SUITE WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH
#   The defect this script exists to prevent is a VACUOUS GATE: a
#   required_status_checks rule carrying an EMPTY context list. Such a rule
#   reports "this branch is protected" in every summary view while requiring
#   nothing at all — strictly worse than having no rule, because it is
#   indistinguishable from a working one.
#
#   A green suite proves nothing about that. So nine of the cases below are
#   MUTANTS: the applier is copied, the guard under test is deliberately
#   removed, and the suite must go RED. A mutant that survives means the
#   corresponding control is decorative.
