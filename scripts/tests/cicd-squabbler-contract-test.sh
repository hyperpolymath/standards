# cicd-squabbler-contract-test.sh — the CI wiring of cicd-squabbler must
# preserve the tool's one invariant (squabble != bypass) at the workflow
# layer, where a well-meaning edit could quietly break it:
#
#   * CI must never pass --apply (propose-only; enactment is a human commit);
#   * the binary must come from the pinned composite action (40-hex commit),
#     never a tag, a branch, or an ad-hoc download;
#   * chains exit 4 (cycle / dead upstream) must fail the job — demoting it
#     to a warning would make the gate advisory in exactly the case it
#     exists for;
#   * generic tool failures (exit 2) must fail too, or a broken advisor
#     reads as an all-clear; downgrade to NOT EVALUATED only when the
#     credential preflight cannot see the whole gate, or the pinned
#     upstream emits its exact hidden-classic-protection wording;
#   * no job may hold a write grant, no secrets may be inherited, and the
#     only declared secret is the optional Administration-read credential
#     that fight needs to see classic branch protection — absent it the
#     advisory says NOT RUN, and with insufficient visibility it says
#     NOT EVALUATED, rather than failing or passing blind;
#   * the caller must carry no paths: filter (a filtered gate never
#     reports on PRs that miss the filter);
#   * both workflows must be present in actions.lock, or GitHub refuses
#     the run at startup and the gate vanishes silently.
#
# Structural (grep) assertions, no network: this is a contract about the
# files, exercised wherever bash runs.
