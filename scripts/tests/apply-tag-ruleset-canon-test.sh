# apply-tag-ruleset-canon-test.sh — behavioural tests for
# scripts/apply-tag-ruleset-canon.sh under per-owner GitHub App tokens.
#
# tests/test_tag_ruleset_canon.sh checks the applier's SOURCE for structural
# guards. This file RUNS the applier against a stub `gh` that models the three
# server facts tag-ruleset-canon.yml depends on once it mints one App
# installation token per owner (RULESET_APP_ID, 2026-10-08):
#
#   1. An installation token (prefix ghs_) cannot call user/repos: that endpoint
#      needs a user identity and an installation has none. The pre-fix applier
#      called it unconditionally, so under `set -e` the hyperpolymath step died
#      before examining a single repository.
#   2. An installation token can write only its own installation's repos. The
#      pre-fix write probe always self-PUT GITHUB_REPOSITORY
#      (hyperpolymath/standards), so the metadatastician step's apply run
#      stopped with a FALSE "credential cannot WRITE rulesets" (exit 3).
#   3. ESTATE_ORGS set to '' (the hyperpolymath step) must mean NO orgs. The
#      pre-fix `${ESTATE_ORGS:-metadatastician}` turned '' back into
#      metadatastician, so the hyperpolymath token also swept repos it cannot
#      write.
#
# Every guard is backed by a mutant that reintroduces the defect and must turn
# the matching case red, and the stub's own refusals are planted positives:
# a stub that never says no would make every case here pass vacuously.
