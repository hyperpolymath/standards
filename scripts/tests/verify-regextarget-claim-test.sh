# Tests for verify-regextarget-claim.sh.
#
# ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE IS ACTUALLY FOR. verify-regextarget-claim.sh is itself a
# gate: it measures whether an anchored value regex suppresses a gitleaks
# `generic-api-key` finding, because the estate once believed it did not and
# steered every repo toward blunt `paths` allowlists on that false basis. A
# measuring gate is only as good as its ABORTS -- if it can be made to report a
# confident answer on a contaminated or mis-versioned instrument, it reproduces
# exactly the wrong belief it exists to disprove.
#
# So these cases do not test the gitleaks semantics (that is the script's own
# job, and it needs a real gitleaks). They test that the script REFUSES to
# answer when it cannot answer honestly. Every case drives the script with a
# STUB gitleaks, so the guards are exercised deterministically on any host,
# with or without gitleaks installed.
