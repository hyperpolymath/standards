# check-inline-python-test.sh — fixture suite for scripts/check-inline-python.sh.
#
# Proves three things, each with a planted positive:
#   1. every embedded-Python form is caught, and look-alikes are not;
#   2. the ledger is shrink-only: new path, grown count and stale entry all fail;
#   3. the suite itself can see a regression — two mutants of the gate (stale
#      check deleted, `-c` form deleted) must each turn one case green.
#
# Fixture text is assembled from fragments ($PY, $PIP) so this file never
# contains the literal forms and does not appear in the gate's own scan.
#
# Run: bash scripts/tests/check-inline-python-test.sh
