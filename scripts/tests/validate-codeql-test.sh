# Tests for .githooks/validate-codeql.sh, the pre-commit gate.
#
# ⚠ TEST 1 IS THE REASON THIS EXISTS. The validator detected languages with
#
#     HAS_RS=$(find "$SCAN_PATH" -name "*.rs" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
#
# under `set -euo pipefail`. `head` exits after one line; `find` then writes
# into a closed pipe, is killed by SIGPIPE, the pipeline reports 141, `pipefail`
# propagates that to the assignment, and `set -e` terminates the script with NO
# OUTPUT — on a perfectly valid repository. Measured: 6 of 6 runs exit 141
# against this repo, and the gate blocked every commit while printing nothing.
#
# WHAT ACTUALLY TRIGGERS IT — and the reason the first version of this test was
# vacuous. It is not the number of matches; it is whether `find` still has
# output pending once `head` is gone. A 20-file fixture in a shallow tree fits
# in the 64K pipe buffer, so find finishes writing and exits 0 and the BUGGY
# validator PASSES. The fixture below emits ~86KB of paths, exceeding the pipe
# buffer, which makes the SIGPIPE deterministic rather than a scheduling race:
# measured 5/5 exit 141 buggy, 5/5 exit 0 fixed. Any future edit that shrinks
# this fixture silently disarms the test.
#
# ⚠ WHAT THIS TEST DOES NOT CLAIM. The `[[ "$HAS_PY" ]] && ! grep -q ... && echo`
# lines were also converted to `if` blocks, but that is hygiene, NOT a bug fix:
# those lists sit at TOP LEVEL, and `set -e` does not exit on a short-circuited
# AND-OR list there (verified: `set -e; X=""; [[ "$X" ]] && echo never; echo
# SURVIVED` prints SURVIVED). The same form IS fatal as the last command of a
# function, which is the separate, genuine bug fixed in
# .githooks/validate-spdx-workflows.sh — see that test. Tests 5-7 below are
# therefore guards against regression, and they pass against the old code too.
