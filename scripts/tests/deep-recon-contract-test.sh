# deep-recon-contract-test.sh — holds the deep-recon wiring to the two
# properties that make it trustworthy rather than decorative:
#
#   * pons gates ONLY at error severity and SPECULATIVE findings are
#     omitted, never gated on (the tool's own contract: never dress a
#     heuristic up as a proof). Lowering --fail-on, or dropping
#     --no-speculative, would break that silently;
#   * a scanner that cannot run, or produces nothing parseable, fails —
#     including panic-attack, whose findings are report-only this cycle.
#     "Report-only findings" must never decay into "report-only tool";
#   * both tools are pinned to 40-hex commits, the scope files
#     (.ponsignore, pons.toml) exist so exclusions are declared in the
#     open, and the workflows are in actions.lock.
