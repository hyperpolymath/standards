# Wave-8 "tighten the gates" regression test.
#
# Every promoted gate must demonstrably BLOCK on bad input and PASS on good:
#   * apply-baseline.sh blocking mode: unbaselined high/critical finding fails;
#     baselined finding passes; EXPIRED baseline entry no longer suppresses.
#   * Mustfile PR gate: the exact commands registry-verify.yml runs succeed on
#     this repo, and a broken Mustfile fails them (via the wave-1 runner).
