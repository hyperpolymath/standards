# governance-gates-505-test.sh — fixture suite for the two governance gates
# promoted from theatre to real checks in standards#505:
#
#   scripts/check-docs-presence.sh   (was: `::warning::` only)
#   scripts/check-package-policy.sh  (was: unconditional `✅ ... passed`)
#
# Issue #505 requires each change be proved with BOTH a pass and a fail fixture
# before merge, and notes that `standards` CI does not exercise the reusable
# (callers pin a SHA) — so watching standards go green proves nothing. This
# suite is the proof: it drives every branch of both gates, on both sides of the
# grace cutoff, via the DOCS_TODAY / PKG_TODAY test seams.
