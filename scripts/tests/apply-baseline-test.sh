# apply-baseline-test.sh — regression test for apply-baseline.sh's
# file_pattern glob handling.
#
# The original implementation referenced `.file_pattern` inside `test(...)`,
# where jq rebinds `.` to test's input (a string), causing a "Cannot index
# string" error that was silently masked by `select(...)`'s error-tolerance
# and produced an always-matches result. This test pins both the exact-file
# and glob paths so the regression cannot recur.
