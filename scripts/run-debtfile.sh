# run-debtfile.sh — EXECUTE the probes declared in a Debtfile.a2ml.
#
# This is the executable half of Debtfile checking;
# scripts/check-debtfile-structure.sh is the structural half.
#
# Each '### <id>' block declares a `- probe:` — a shell command that prints a
# single non-negative integer: how much of that debt exists right now. The
# runner re-measures every entry and compares against the declared `ceiling`.
#
#   measured >  ceiling   ❌ debt grew past what this repo tolerates
#   measured <  ceiling   ✅ paid down (with --write, the ceiling follows it down)
#   measured == 0         🎉 resolved
#   accepted-until passed  ⏰ expired — the acceptance was time-boxed and the time is up
#
# ⚠ NO FALLBACK. A probe that fails to run, or prints anything other than an
#   integer, is a HARD FAILURE. This is the single most important property of
#   the whole mechanism. A probe that returns 0 on error is indistinguishable
#   from zero debt, and zero is the state that passes — so a broken probe would
#   silently report a clean repo. Every estate gate that has ever lied did it
#   this way. See scripts/count-ledger-entries.sh for the same rule stated for
#   the exemption ledgers.
#
# ⚠ A PROBE MUST RESPECT EXISTING CARVE-OUTS. Naive probes manufacture debt.
#   During this file's own authoring, three candidate probes were rejected for
#   counting comments and documentation examples as violations:
#     * `uses:` without a 40-char SHA        → matched usage examples in comments
#     * scripts containing `python3`         → matched a comment saying "not python3"
#     * scripts with no matching test file   → counted the test files themselves
#   Validate a new probe against a hand-checked number before committing it.
#
# Usage: run-debtfile.sh [--write] [path/to/Debtfile.a2ml]
#   --write   update `count` in place, and lower `ceiling` to match when debt
#             has been paid down (the auto-ratchet). Never raises a ceiling.
#   Default path: .machine_readable/Debtfile.a2ml
#
# Exit: 0 all entries at or under ceiling · 1 a ceiling was breached, a probe
#       failed, or an acceptance expired · 2 file missing / bad invocation
