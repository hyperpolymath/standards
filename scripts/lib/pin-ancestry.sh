# pin-ancestry.sh — the ONE ancestry assertion every pin bumper calls
# (owner ruling D5c, standards#787; mandatory under D19a).
#
# Source it; do not execute it:
#
#   . "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib/pin-ancestry.sh"
#   assert_pin_ancestry hyperpolymath/standards "$sha" || exit 1
#
# WHY: a pin can be a real commit that GitHub still refuses to run. A PR head
# that is later squash-merged, or a commit on a deleted unmerged branch, is an
# ancestor of nothing; `commits/<sha>` still answers 200, but a cross-repo
# reusable-workflow ref at that SHA dies at graph resolution (standards#782:
# 61 dead rows, 0 alive). Squash is the estate's only merge method (D19a), so
# every bumper that may be handed a PR head must prove ancestry before writing.
#
# PREDICATE: compare/<sha>...<branch> on the server.
#   identical | ahead   → <sha> is an ancestor of <branch>       → rc 0
#   behind | diverged   → NOT an ancestor; never pin it          → rc 1
#   not hex / not 40    → refuse; abbreviated SHAs are prefix
#                         queries, not existence tests            → rc 1
#   no/unknown answer   → indeterminate; callers must refuse too  → rc 2
# The comparison is server-side on purpose: `git merge-base --is-ancestor` in a
# shallow or partial clone reports false negatives (standards#782). A caller
# may try a full local clone first, but only this function may say "no" from
# incomplete local evidence.
