# check-canon-lockstep.sh — GATE A.
#
# Proposed location: hyperpolymath/standards/scripts/check-canon-lockstep.sh
# Runs from:         .github/workflows/canon-spine-lockstep.yml
#
# This is the gate that makes `standards` BOUND BY `rsr-template-repo`.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT IT ENFORCES
#
#   HARD (always):
#   1  every sha256 in canon.lock [canon.artifacts] matches the working tree
#   2  touching a canon artefact forces a version bump
#
#   INFORMATIONAL unless --strict:
#   3  the spine declares criteria_sha256 == canon.lock's criteria hash
#   4  the spine is GREEN against those criteria
#   5  the canon itself scores Gold on its own applicable set
#
#   See softfail() for why 3/4/5 must not be hard by default.
#
# Assertion 4 is the load-bearing one, and it is a deliberate reversal:
#
#     YOU MAY NOT TIGHTEN THE CRITERIA UNTIL THE REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION
#     PASSES THEM.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# USAGE
#   check-canon-lockstep.sh [--canon DIR] [--spine DIR] [--base REF] [--strict]
#
#   --canon DIR   path to hyperpolymath/standards   (default: .)
#   --spine DIR   path to a cloned rsr-template-repo
#   --base REF    the ref to diff against for assertion 2 (default: origin/main)
#   --strict      promote assertions 3/4/5 from SKIP to FAIL
#
# EXIT
#   0  all enabled assertions passed
#   1  at least one assertion failed
#   2  setup error (missing file, unresolvable ref)
#
# DEPENDENCIES
#   bash        (no python - estate policy: see docs/JS-RUNTIME-POLICY.adoc,
#                NO-JAVASCRIPT-SOURCE-POLICY.adoc; bash + awk + git only)
