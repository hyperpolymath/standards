# check-debt-ratchet.sh — a Debtfile's ceilings may fall, never rise silently.
#
# Sibling to scripts/check-exemption-ratchet.sh, which does the same job for
# the four exemption ledgers. The two govern different populations:
#
#   exemption ratchet — debt you have EXCUSED   (baseline, ignores, allowlists)
#                       "did you quietly excuse more?"
#   debt ratchet      — debt you have MEASURED  (Debtfile.a2ml)
#                       "did the number go up?"
#
# Three rules:
#
#   1. NO SILENT RAISE. A ceiling may fall freely. Raising one needs a
#      declaration in the commit message.
#
#   2. NO SILENT DELETION. An entry leaves the Debtfile by reaching zero, not
#      by being deleted. Deleting an entry is how measured debt becomes
#      invisible debt, and it is the exact analogue of the `**` wildcard the
#      exemption ratchet rejects in the migration ledger: the file appears to
#      hold steady while what it covers quietly changes. Deletion needs the
#      same declaration a raise does.
#
#   3. NO UNDECLARED NEW CEILING ABOVE ZERO for an entry that did not exist.
#      Adding an entry is honest and welcome — that is how debt gets recorded.
#      It is allowed without ceremony.  (Rule kept explicit so nobody "fixes"
#      the gate by making declaration mandatory here; that would punish the
#      one behaviour this file wants to encourage.)
#
# Escape hatch, per-entry, never blanket:
#
#     Debt-exception: <entry id> — <why>
#     Debt-exception(<entry id>): <why>
#
# ⚠ A declaration naming no known entry is REJECTED rather than treated as
#   blanket permission, because "unparseable" must never mean "allowed". This
#   is the bug the exemption ratchet shipped with and had to fix: a single bare
#   `Ratchet-exception:` licensed growth in all four ledgers at once.

Debt ratchet: FAILED.

A debt ceiling rose, or an entry was deleted, without saying so.

If the change is correct — a newly vendored tree, a probe corrected to count
something it was wrongly excluding, a concern that genuinely moved elsewhere —
declare it in the commit message, naming the entry:

    Debt-exception: docs-md-not-adoc — vendored upstream handbook adds 40 .md
    files that are not ours to convert

If it is not correct, pay the debt down rather than raising the ceiling.
