Organization-wide standards, specifications, and governance templates for the Hyperpolymath ecosystem.

toc::[]

== Overview

This repository serves as the canonical source for policies, templates, and specifications governing all Hyperpolymath projects. It provides:

* **Language Policy** — Which languages and tools are permitted across the ecosystem
* **Governance Templates** — Reusable CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, and SECURITY documents
* **Licensing Framework** — Dual MIT/AGPL-3.0-or-later with Palimpsest philosophical principles
* **Infrastructure** — Multi-forge synchronization and CI/CD workflows

== Contents

=== Language Policy

The link:.claude/CLAUDE.md[Hyperpolymath Language Policy] defines the technology stack permitted across all projects:

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Category |Allowed |Banned

|**Primary Languages**
|ReScript, Rust, Gleam
|TypeScript, Go, Java/Kotlin

|**Runtime**
|Deno
|Node.js, npm, Bun, pnpm, yarn

|**Mobile**
|Tauri 2.0+, Dioxus
|React Native, Flutter/Dart, Swift, Kotlin

|**Config**
|Nickel, Guile Scheme
|—

|**Special Purpose**
|Python (SaltStack only), Julia (batch), OCaml (AffineScript), Ada (safety-critical)
|Python (general)
|===

*Rationale:* Preference for FOSS tools with independent governance (no Big Tech dependencies), type safety, and Rust-first mobile development.

=== Governance Templates

Reusable templates with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values for consistent project governance:

* `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Based on Contributor Covenant 2.1 with perimeter-based enforcement
* `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Development workflow, branch naming, commit conventions
* `SECURITY.md` — Vulnerability reporting, disclosure policy, safe harbour provisions

=== Palimpsest Principles

The licensing framework includes a non-binding philosophical overlay encouraging:

* **Consent-based digital interaction** — Explicit permission for data use
* **Transparent AI training practices** — Opt-in rather than opt-out
* **Preservation of metadata and attribution** — Maintaining creative lineage
* **Protection of narrative intent** — Respecting cultural context

See: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/palimpsest-license[Palimpsest License]

=== Infrastructure

* **Instant Forge Sync** — GitHub Actions workflow triggering propagation to all forges on push/release
* **CodeQL Analysis** — Automated security scanning
* **Issue Templates** — Standardized bug reports, feature requests, documentation issues, questions

== Usage

=== For New Hyperpolymath Projects

1. Copy templates to your repository
2. Replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values
3. Add the language policy to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
4. Configure forge sync (requires `FARM_DISPATCH_TOKEN`)

=== For Contributors

* Read the link:.claude/CLAUDE.md[Language Policy] before proposing code
* Follow the template in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for your project
* Report security issues per `SECURITY.md`
