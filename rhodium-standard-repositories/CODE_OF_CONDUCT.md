## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
* Focusing on what is best for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and
will take appropriate corrective action.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and when officially
representing the community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive or unacceptable behavior may be reported via the project’s
private reporting channel as documented in `docs/community/ENFORCEMENT.adoc`.
