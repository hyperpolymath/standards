Detailed explanation of the Rhodium Pipeline Template licensing structure.

toc::[]

== License Overview

Rhodium Pipeline Template uses a *dual licensing* model with a *philosophical overlay*:

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Component |License |Binding

|Template code
|MIT OR AGPL-3.0-or-later
|Legally binding (choose one)

|Generated projects
|Inherits from user choice
|Legally binding

|Palimpsest principles
|Philosophical overlay
|Non-binding (encouraged)
|===

== Dual License: MIT OR AGPL-3.0

You may use this template under *either* license at your choice:

=== MIT License

The MIT License is a permissive open-source license that allows:

* Commercial use without restriction
* Modification and distribution
* Private use
* Sublicensing

*Requirements:* Include copyright notice and license text in copies.

=== AGPL-3.0-or-later

The GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 is a copyleft license that:

* Ensures source code remains open
* Requires disclosure for network services (SaaS)
* Propagates to derivative works

*Requirements:* Distribute source code for modifications, including network services.

== Choosing Your License

=== For Most Users: MIT

Choose MIT if:

* You want maximum flexibility
* You're building proprietary software
* You don't want copyleft obligations
* You're embedding in a larger project with different licensing

=== For Open Source Advocates: AGPL-3.0

Choose AGPL-3.0 if:

* You want to ensure derivatives remain open source
* You're building a SaaS and want source disclosure
* You prefer strong copyleft protections
* You want to prevent proprietary forks

== Generated Project Licensing

When you generate a project, you select a license during the prompts:

[source,bash]
----
# During generation:
? Base license (MIT or AGPL-3.0)? [MIT, AGPL-3.0]
----

Your generated project inherits:

1. *Your chosen license* (MIT or AGPL-3.0) for the base code
2. *Palimpsest overlay* (non-binding, encouraged)

The generated `LICENSE` file reflects your choice.

== Palimpsest Philosophical Overlay

The Palimpsest License is a *non-binding philosophical framework* encouraging:

=== Core Principles

1. **Emotional Lineage** — Respect the creative and emotional history of code
2. **Consent-Based AI** — Require explicit consent for AI training
3. **Metadata Preservation** — Maintain attribution and provenance
4. **Cultural Context** — Protect narrative intent and meaning

=== Practical Application

While not legally enforceable, we encourage:

* Acknowledging original authors beyond legal requirements
* Seeking consent before using code for AI training datasets
* Preserving meaningful comments and documentation context
* Respecting the intent behind code, not just the letter
