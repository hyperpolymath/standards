== Overview

The Rhodium Standard Repositories project uses the *Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)* for graduated trust and distributed governance. This document defines how decisions are made, who has what authority, and how the project evolves.

=== Core Principles

* **Consensus-seeking**: We prefer agreement over voting when possible
* **Graduated trust**: Permissions grow with demonstrated reliability
* **Reversibility**: Most decisions can be revisited and changed
* **Transparency**: All governance processes are public
* **Community over ego**: Technical merit and collaboration trump seniority

=== Document Scope

This governance model applies to:

* The main `rhodium-standard-repositories` project
* All sub-projects and examples maintained under this umbrella
* Community spaces (Matrix, GitLab, future forums)
* Project resources (domains, infrastructure, social media)

== Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

The TPCF provides graduated trust without gatekeeping—everyone can contribute, but scope matches expertise.

=== Perimeter 1: Core Systems 🔒

*Access*: Maintainers only (write access to main branch)

*Languages*: Rust, Nickel, Bash, Haskell, Ada

*Scope*:
* Audit system (`rsr-audit.sh`)
* Build systems and CI/CD templates
* Core SPDX audit infrastructure
* Main documentation (README, GOVERNANCE, SECURITY)
* Haskell registry (when implemented)

*Contribution*: Closed. Direct commits by core maintainers only.

*Rationale*: Architectural integrity > open contribution for foundational systems.

=== Perimeter 2: Expert Extensions 🧠

*Access*: Trusted contributors (can approve MRs for their domains)

*Languages*: Rust, Elixir, ReScript, Haskell, Ada, Nickel, controlled Bash

*Scope*:
* Example repositories (beyond minimal)
* Repository templates
* Protocol extensions
* Compliance validators
* Testing infrastructure
* Documentation tooling (DocGementer)

*Contribution*: Apply via issue → review → merge under appropriate directory.

*Requirements*:
* Unit tests with ≥80% coverage
* Documentation with examples
* SPDX headers on all files
* Security impact assessment for risky changes

*Application process*:
1. Open issue: `[Trusted Contributor] Application: @username`
2. Link to 20+ prior contributions OR demonstrate deep expertise
3. Specify areas of interest
4. Core team reviews within 2 weeks
5. Onboarding session with mentor

=== Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox 🌱

*Access*: Open to all (fork → MR workflow)

*Languages*: Shell, Markdown, AsciiDoc, JSON, Nickel, any for examples

*Scope*:
* Documentation improvements
* Spec tests and compliance proposals
* Example repositories (new)
* Tutorials and guides
* Translations
* Bug reports and issues

*Contribution*: Fork → edit → add to appropriate directory → create MR.

*Validation*: `just validate` locally, CI enforces SPDX/schema/formatting.

*Process*:
1. Fork the repository
2. Make changes in your fork
3. Run `just validate` to ensure compliance
4. Open merge request with clear description
5. Address review feedback
6. Maintainer merges when approved

== Decision-Making Process

=== Types of Decisions

We categorize decisions by impact and use appropriate processes:

[cols="1,2,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Type | Examples | Process | Required Approval

| **Routine**
| Bug fixes, typos, clarifications
| Single maintainer approval
| 1 maintainer

| **Minor**
| New examples, documentation improvements, small features
| Maintainer consensus (no objections)
| 2 maintainers

| **Major**
| Architectural changes, new perimeters, policy changes
| Consensus with fallback to vote
| Core team consensus or 2/3 vote

| **Critical**
| License changes, CoC changes, project dissolution
| Supermajority vote + community input period
| 2/3 core team + 2-week community feedback
|===

=== Consensus Process

Our preferred decision-making method:

1. **Proposal**: Issue or merge request created with `~governance` label
2. **Discussion**: Minimum 3 business days for feedback
3. **Refinement**: Proposal updated based on input
4. **Consensus check**: Maintainers indicate support/concerns/objections
5. **Resolution**:
   * No objections = consensus achieved
   * Minor concerns = proposal proceeds with noted reservations
   * Major objections = more discussion or vote

=== Voting Process

When consensus cannot be reached:

*Eligibility*: Core maintainers only

*Quorum*: 2/3 of core maintainers must participate

*Thresholds*:
* **Simple majority** (>50%): Minor and routine decisions
* **Supermajority** (≥66.67%): Major changes
* **Unanimous** (100%): Critical changes (or 2-week community feedback + 2/3)

*Timeline*:
* Voting period: 7 days minimum
* Extension: Any maintainer can request +7 days once
* Early close: Unanimous votes can close early

*Procedure*:
1. Issue labeled `~vote` created with clear proposal
2. Maintainers vote: ✅ Yes, ❌ No, 🤔 Abstain
3. Abstentions don't count toward quorum
4. Result announced, rationale documented
5. Implementation timeline specified

=== Private Security Discussions

Security issues are discussed in:
* Confidential GitLab issues (label: `~security ~confidential`)
* Private Matrix channel (core maintainers only)
* Encrypted email (security@rhodium-standard.org)

== Release Management

=== Versioning

We follow **Semantic Versioning 2.0.0**:

* **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, architectural overhauls
* **MINOR** (x.Y.0): New features, backwards-compatible
* **PATCH** (x.y.Z): Bug fixes, security patches

=== Release Cadence

* **Major releases**: When ready (no schedule)
* **Minor releases**: Quarterly (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)
* **Patch releases**: As needed for bugs/security

=== Release Process

1. **Preparation** (1 week before):
   * Create release branch: `release/vX.Y.Z`
   * Update version numbers
   * Move CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` to version section
   * Run full validation: `just validate`
   * Build all examples: `just build-all`
   * Generate SBOM: `just sbom-generate`

2. **Review** (3 days):
   * Core team reviews release branch
   * Test examples and audit script
   * Verify documentation accuracy

3. **Release** (release day):
   * Merge release branch to main
   * Create signed git tag: `git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`
   * Push tag: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
   * Publish GitLab release with notes
   * Update badges in README.adoc if compliance changed
   * Announce on Matrix, GitLab, social media

4. **Post-Release** (1 week after):
   * Monitor for issues
   * Address critical bugs with patch release
   * Close related issues and milestone

=== Release Roles

* **Release Manager**: Core maintainer who coordinates release
* **QA Lead**: Tests examples and validates compliance
* **Documentation Lead**: Ensures docs are current and accurate
* **Communications Lead**: Handles announcements and social media

Roles rotate quarterly among core maintainers.

== Conflict Resolution

We expect disagreements—it's healthy! Here's how we handle them:

=== Process

1. **Direct Communication** (first step):
   * Talk directly with person you disagree with
   * Assume good intent
   * Focus on issues, not people
   * Use private channels if sensitive

2. **Mediation** (if direct communication doesn't resolve):
   * Request mediation from uninvolved core maintainer
   * Mediator facilitates conversation, doesn't decide
   * Focus on finding win-win solutions

3. **Escalation** (if mediation doesn't resolve):
   * Bring to full core team for decision
   * Follow consensus or voting process
   * Document decision and rationale

4. **Appeal** (if you disagree with core team decision):
   * Submit appeal within 7 days
   * Core team reconsiders with fresh perspective
   * Final decision made, documented

=== Code of Conduct Violations

CoC violations bypass normal conflict resolution:

1. Report to code-of-conduct@rhodium-standard.org
2. CoC response team investigates (2 core maintainers, not involved)
3. Response within 48 hours (acknowledgement), 1 week (resolution)
4. Actions range from warning to permanent ban
5. Appeal process available (see CODE_OF_CONDUCT)

== Succession Planning

We plan for continuity to ensure project longevity.

=== Bus Factor Mitigation

* **Minimum 3 core maintainers** at all times
* **Cross-training**: No single points of failure
* **Documentation**: All processes documented (this file!)
* **Credential rotation**: Multiple people have access to infrastructure

=== Maintainer Succession

When a core maintainer steps down:

1. Announce intention (private or public)
2. Transition period (2 weeks ideal, flexible)
3. Update MAINTAINERS.md
4. Transfer responsibilities to remaining maintainers
5. Optionally move to emeritus status

When a core maintainer is incapacitated:

1. Remaining maintainers assume responsibilities
2. Promote trusted contributor to core if needed (expedited process)
3. Attempt to contact incapacitated maintainer
4. After 6 months, formally transition to emeritus

=== Project Archival

If project becomes unmaintained:

* Post prominent notice in README
* Archive repository (read-only)
* Update security.txt with end-of-support date
* Offer to transfer to new maintainer team (requires 2/3 approval of community)

== Amendment Process

This governance document can be amended:

=== Minor Amendments

* Clarifications, typo fixes, formatting
* Single core maintainer approval
* Announce change in next release notes

=== Major Amendments

* Changes to TPCF structure, voting thresholds, roles
