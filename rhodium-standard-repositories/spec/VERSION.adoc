[IMPORTANT]
====
This document defines *RSR Version 1.0* as a frozen specification.
Changes to this version require a new major version (2.0).
====

== What is "Standard"

The Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR) v1.0 is the complete, frozen definition of what constitutes a compliant repository under the *Campaign for Cooler Coding and Programming (CCCP)*.

=== Canonical Definition

A *Rhodium Standard Repository* is one that meets the following immutable criteria:

[quote, RSR v1.0]
____
A Rhodium Standard Repository is a comprehensive framework for *emotionally safe*, *technically excellent*, and *politically autonomous* software development that considers the entire lifecycle from upstream dependencies to downstream human impact.
____

=== Version 1.0 Freeze Date

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Freeze Date | 2025-12-27
| Effective From | 2025-12-27
| Supersedes | All prior drafts
| Status | *FROZEN*
|===

== Locked Components

The following components are locked in v1.0. Any changes require a new specification version.

=== 1. Compliance Tiers (LOCKED)

[cols="1,1,2,1"]
|===
| Tier | Score | Requirements | Status

| image:../badges/rsr-bronze.svg[Bronze,24] Bronze
| 75-89%
| README, LICENSE.txt, SECURITY.md, CI/CD, SPDX headers
| *LOCKED*

| image:../badges/rsr-silver.svg[Silver,24] Silver
| 90-99%
| +GOVERNANCE.adoc, MAINTAINERS.md, Scorecard ≥7.0
| *LOCKED*

| image:../badges/rsr-gold.svg[Gold,24] Gold
| 100%
| +STATE.scm, META.scm, ECOSYSTEM.scm, Scorecard ≥9.0
| *LOCKED*

| image:../badges/rsr-rhodium.svg[Rhodium,24] Rhodium
| 100%+
| +Formal verification, community recognition
| *LOCKED*
|===

=== 2. Compliance Categories (LOCKED)

11 categories, weighted as follows:

[cols="1,3,1,1"]
|===
| ID | Category | Weight | Status

| 1 | Foundational Infrastructure | 15% | *LOCKED*
| 2 | Documentation Standards | 10% | *LOCKED*
| 3 | Security Architecture | 15% | *LOCKED*
| 4 | Architecture Principles | 10% | *LOCKED*
| 5 | Web Standards & Protocols | 10% | *LOCKED*
| 6 | Semantic Web & IndieWeb | 5% | *LOCKED*
| 7 | FOSS & Licensing | 10% | *LOCKED*
| 8 | Cognitive Ergonomics | 5% | *LOCKED*
| 9 | Lifecycle Management | 5% | *LOCKED*
| 10 | Community & Governance | 10% | *LOCKED*
| 11 | Mutually Assured Accountability | 5% | *LOCKED*
|===

=== 3. Language Policy (LOCKED)

==== Allowed Languages

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Language | Primary Use Case

| *ReScript* | Primary application code (OCaml soundness)
| *Rust* | Systems programming, WASM, CLI tools
| *Deno* | Runtime & package management (replaces Node)
| *Gleam* | Backend services (BEAM or JS target)
| *OCaml* | Compilers, formal methods
| *Ada* | Safety-critical systems (SPARK verification)
| *Julia* | Data processing, batch scripts
| *Guile Scheme* | State/meta files (STATE.scm, etc.)
| *Nickel* | Configuration language
| *Bash/POSIX* | Minimal scripting, automation
|===

==== Banned Languages

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Language | Replacement | Rationale

| TypeScript | ReScript | Unsound gradual typing
| Node.js | Deno | Insecure by default
| npm/Bun/pnpm/yarn | Deno | Supply chain risks
| Go | Rust | Error handling, generics
| Python (general) | ReScript/Rust | No static types
| Java/Kotlin | Rust | JVM overhead
| Swift | Tauri/Dioxus | Platform lock-in
|===

*Exception*: Python permitted for SaltStack only (temporary, slated for removal).

=== 4. Required Files (LOCKED)

==== Root Files

[cols="2,1,2"]
|===
| File | Required Tier | Notes

| `README.md` or `README.adoc` | Bronze | Project overview
| `LICENSE.txt` | Bronze | SPDX-identified, plain text
| `SECURITY.md` | Bronze | Vulnerability policy
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` or `.adoc` | Bronze (rec.) | Community standards

|===

==== .well-known/ Directory

[cols="2,1,2"]
|===
| File | Required Tier | Purpose

| `security.txt` | Silver | Security contact info
| `ai.txt` | Gold | AI crawling policies
| `humans.txt` | Gold | Human attribution
| `provenance.json` | Gold | Content provenance
| `consent-required.txt` | Gold (opt.) | HTTP 430 consent
|===

=== 5. Core Principles (LOCKED)

The CCCP principles are immutable in v1.0:

. *Emotional Safety* — Reversibility, no shame, safe experimentation
. *Offline-First* — Intermittent connectivity never blocks work
. *Post-JavaScript Liberation* — Escape npm/node ecosystem fragility
. *Formal Verification* — Correctness as solidarity
. *Community Over Ego* — Architecture enforces collaboration
. *Language Polyglotism* — Diverse languages resist monoculture

=== 6. Contribution Model (LOCKED)

The *Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)* is locked:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Perimeter | Languages | Access

| 🔒 Core (P1) | Rust, Nickel, Bash | Maintainers only
| 🧠 Expert (P2) | Rust, Nickel, Bash, Python | Trusted contributors
| 🌱 Sandbox (P3) | Shell, Markdown, AsciiDoc, JSON | Open to all
|===

== Versioning Policy

=== Semantic Versioning

RSR follows Semantic Versioning for the specification itself:

* *MAJOR* (X.0.0): Breaking changes, locked criteria modifications
* *MINOR* (1.X.0): New optional criteria, clarifications, addenda
* *PATCH* (1.0.X): Typo fixes, editorial corrections

=== Stability Guarantees

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Guarantee | Description

| *Backward Compatibility*
| v1.0-compliant repos remain compliant in v1.x

| *Deprecation Notice*
| Criteria removal requires 2 minor versions notice

| *Freeze Commitment*
| Locked items cannot change without major version
|===

== Machine-Readable Specification

The canonical machine-readable definition is in `spec.scm/`:

[source]
----
spec.scm/
├── compliance-criteria.scm  # 11 categories, 50+ criteria
├── tiers.scm                # Bronze/Silver/Gold/Rhodium
└── language-policy.scm      # Allowed/banned languages
----

These files are the *source of truth* for automated tooling.

== Satellite Standards

The following satellite specifications are referenced but *versioned independently*:

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
| Satellite | Purpose | Versioning

| Palimpsest License | Multi-layered license framework | 0.8+
| Mustfile | Type-safe deployment | Separate
| .well-known Ecosystem | RFC 5785 extensions | Separate
| DocGementer | Documentation validation | Separate
|===

== Compliance Validation

=== Self-Audit Command

[source,bash]
----
just rsr-audit
----

=== Badge Declaration

Compliant repositories may display the appropriate badge:

[source,markdown]
----
![RSR v1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/RSR-v1.0-gold)
----

== Future Versions

=== Planned for v1.1

* Additional optional criteria (non-breaking)
* Scorecard integration improvements
* Badge automation via CI

=== Planned for v2.0

* Python SaltStack exception removal
* RISC-V platform requirements
* Enhanced formal verification criteria
