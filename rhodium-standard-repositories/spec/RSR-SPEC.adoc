*Version Status*: v1.0.0 *FROZEN* — See link:VERSION.adoc[VERSION.adoc] for freeze details.

This specification is immutable. Changes require a new major version.

== Overview

The *Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR)* is a comprehensive framework for *emotionally safe, technically excellent, and politically autonomous* software development.

=== Why "Rhodium"?

Rhodium is the *rarest and most precious* of all metals, chosen for specific symbolic properties:

* *Rarest precious metal*: Excellence over ubiquity
* *Catalytic role*: Transforms toxic outputs into safer alternatives
* *Wedding ring plating*: Durability for long-term commitments
* *Corrosion resistance*: Systems that don't decay under pressure

== Core Principles

RSR embodies the *Campaign for Cooler Coding and Programming (CCCP)* philosophy:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Principle | Description

| *Emotional Safety*
| Reversibility, no shame, safe experimentation

| *Offline-First*
| Intermittent connectivity never blocks work

| *Post-JavaScript Liberation*
| Escape npm/node ecosystem fragility

| *Formal Verification*
| Correctness is an act of solidarity

| *Community Over Ego*
| Architecture enforces collaborative patterns

| *Language Polyglotism*
| Diverse languages resist monoculture
|===

== Compliance Tiers

RSR defines four compliance tiers. See link:TIERS.adoc[TIERS.adoc] for full criteria.

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Tier | Score | Description

| image:../badges/rsr-bronze.svg[Bronze,32] *Bronze*
| 75-89%
| Basic compliance - required files, CI/CD, SPDX headers

| image:../badges/rsr-silver.svg[Silver,32] *Silver*
| 90-99%
| Enhanced - governance docs, Scorecard 7.0+, SHA-pinned actions

| image:../badges/rsr-gold.svg[Gold,32] *Gold*
| 100%
| Full compliance - SCM metadata files, Scorecard 9.0+

| image:../badges/rsr-rhodium.svg[Rhodium,32] *Rhodium*
| 100%+
| Exemplary - community recognition, formal verification
