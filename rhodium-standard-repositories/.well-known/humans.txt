Philosophy:
    "We build systems that don't decay under pressure,

     and infrastructure that respects human autonomy."

Principles:
    - Emotional Safety: Reversibility, safe experimentation
    - Offline-First: Autonomy through disconnection capability
    - Post-JavaScript: Liberation from npm fragility
    - Formal Verification: Correctness as mutual aid
    - Community Over Ego: Collaborative architecture
    - Language Polyglotism: Resistance to monoculture
