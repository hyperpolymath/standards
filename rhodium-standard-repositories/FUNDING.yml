# Funding Philosophy
# ------------------
# The Rhodium Standard embraces solidarity economics:
#
# 1. Transparent Use: All funding use documented in financial reports
# 2. Community Governance: Major funding decisions require community input
# 3. Contributor Support: Funding supports active contributors first
# 4. Upstream Sharing: We contribute back to projects we depend on
# 5. Accessibility: Core functionality always free and open source
#
# Funding Priorities:
# - Maintainer stipends (fair compensation for time)
# - Infrastructure costs (hosting, CI/CD, domains)
# - Security audits (third-party validation)
# - Conference travel (spreading RSR adoption)
# - Upstream donations (supporting our dependencies)
# - Community events (meetups, workshops, hackathons)
#
# Financial Transparency:
# - Quarterly reports published
# - OpenCollective provides real-time transparency
# - Major expenditures voted on by core team
# - Annual financial summary in project report
#
# How Funds Are Used:
# - 40%: Maintainer compensation
# - 20%: Infrastructure and tooling
# - 15%: Security and auditing
# - 10%: Community events and outreach
# - 10%: Upstream dependency support
# - 5%: Emergency fund reserve
#
# Thank you for supporting emotionally safe, technically excellent,
# politically autonomous software development!
