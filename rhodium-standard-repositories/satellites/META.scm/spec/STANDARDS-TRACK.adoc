:toc: left

:icons: font

== Executive Summary

This document analyzes potential standards bodies and outlines a phased
strategy for formalizing the META (Machine-readable Engineering and Technical
Architecture) format as an industry standard. The recommended approach is an
IETF Informational RFC with IANA media type registration, complemented by
integration with existing software metadata ecosystems.

== Standards Body Analysis

=== Evaluation Criteria

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Criterion |Description

|Scope Fit
|How well the body's charter matches META's purpose

|Process Accessibility
|Barrier to entry for new specifications

|Industry Recognition
|How widely the standard would be recognized

|Maintenance Model
|How updates and revisions are handled

|Timeline
|Expected time from proposal to standard
|===

=== IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Aspect |Assessment

|*Scope Fit*
|★★★★☆ — IETF standardizes data formats (JSON, iCalendar, GeoJSON) but
META isn't network-focused

|*Process*
|★★★★☆ — Well-documented, open process; Informational RFC track is accessible

|*Recognition*
|★★★★★ — RFC status is universally recognized

|*Maintenance*
|★★★★☆ — RFC errata and bis documents for updates

|*Timeline*
|~18-36 months for Informational RFC
|===

*Precedents:*

* RFC 8259 (JSON) — Data format standard
* RFC 5545 (iCalendar) — Structured data with similar ADR-like patterns
* RFC 7946 (GeoJSON) — Domain-specific data format

*Recommendation:* **PRIMARY PATH** — Informational RFC is ideal for
format specifications without protocol elements.

=== IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Aspect |Assessment

|*Scope Fit*
|★★★★★ — Media type registration is directly applicable

|*Process*
|★★★★★ — Straightforward registration process

|*Recognition*
|★★★★★ — Official media type enables tool integration

|*Maintenance*
|★★★★★ — Registry updates are simple

|*Timeline*
|~3-6 months for provisional, longer for permanent
|===

*Registration Types:*

* **Provisional** — Quick registration for community review
* **Permanent** — Requires RFC or equivalent specification

*Recommendation:* **REQUIRED** — Media type registration is essential
for META adoption. Register `application/meta+scheme`.

=== ISO/IEC JTC 1

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Aspect |Assessment

|*Scope Fit*
|★★★☆☆ — Covers software engineering standards but heavy process

|*Process*
|★★☆☆☆ — Complex, lengthy, requires national body sponsorship

|*Recognition*
|★★★★★ — ISO standards have highest formal recognition

|*Maintenance*
|★★☆☆☆ — Updates require full revision cycle

|*Timeline*
|3-5 years minimum
|===

*Relevant Subcommittees:*

* SC 7 (Software and systems engineering)
* SC 32 (Data management and interchange)

*Recommendation:* **FUTURE CONSIDERATION** — Consider ISO track only after
successful IETF standardization and widespread adoption (5+ years).

=== ECMA International

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Aspect |Assessment

|*Scope Fit*
|★★☆☆☆ — Primarily programming languages and APIs, not data formats

|*Process*
|★★★★☆ — More accessible than ISO, corporate membership model

|*Recognition*
|★★★★☆ — Strong in programming language community

|*Maintenance*
|★★★★☆ — Annual revision cycles

|*Timeline*
|12-24 months
|===

*Recommendation:* **NOT RECOMMENDED** — META isn't a programming language
or runtime API, which is ECMA's focus.

=== W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Aspect |Assessment

|*Scope Fit*
|★★☆☆☆ — Web-focused; META isn't inherently web technology

|*Process*
|★★★☆☆ — Requires working group formation and member support

|*Recognition*
|★★★★★ — Very strong in web ecosystem

|*Maintenance*
|★★★★☆ — Living standards model works well

|*Timeline*
|24-48 months
|===

*Potential Interest:*

* JSON-LD context for META data
* Integration with Schema.org vocabularies

*Recommendation:* **SECONDARY PATH** — Consider W3C JSON-LD context
as complementary standard after core specification.

=== Linux Foundation / SPDX

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Aspect |Assessment

|*Scope Fit*
|★★★★★ — SPDX already handles software metadata and licensing

|*Process*
|★★★★☆ — Community-driven, accessible

|*Recognition*
|★★★★☆ — Strong in open source community

|*Maintenance*
|★★★★★ — Active development, regular releases

|*Timeline*
|6-18 months for extension proposal
|===

*Integration Points:*

* SPDX already handles license metadata (which META references)
* Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) alignment
* Potential for META as SPDX extension or companion spec

*Recommendation:* **COMPLEMENTARY** — Pursue SPDX alignment for
license and dependency metadata interoperability.

=== OpenAPI Initiative / Linux Foundation

[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Aspect |Assessment

|*Scope Fit*
|★★★☆☆ — API specifications, not project metadata

|*Process*
|★★★★☆ — Open governance, community-driven

|*Recognition*
|★★★★☆ — Strong in API development

|*Maintenance*
|★★★★★ — Active TSC, regular releases

|*Timeline*
|N/A — Different scope
|===

*Recommendation:* **NOT APPLICABLE** — Different domain, but good
model for governance structure.

== Appendix B: Comparison to Similar Standardization Efforts

[cols="1,2,2,1"]
|===
|Format |Standards Body |Time to Standard |Status

|JSON (RFC 8259)
|IETF
|~3 years (including earlier RFCs)
|Standard

|iCalendar (RFC 5545)
|IETF
|~4 years
|Standard

|GeoJSON (RFC 7946)
|IETF
|~3 years
|Informational

|SPDX
|Linux Foundation / ISO
|~5 years to ISO
|ISO/IEC 5962:2021

|OpenAPI
|Linux Foundation
|~2 years (community spec)
|Community Standard

|ADR (MADR)
|None
|N/A
|De facto
|===

META aims to follow the GeoJSON model: community specification first,
then IETF Informational RFC, with potential ISO fast-track later.
