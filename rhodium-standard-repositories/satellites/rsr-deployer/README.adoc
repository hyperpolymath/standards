[abstract]
This repository conforms to the **Rhodium Standard**. It utilizes a type-safe, contract-driven orchestration layer via the **Mustfile** and **Nickel-Augmented (`nicaug`)** engine. Designed for deployment across Linux (Kinoite/Debian), Minix, macOS, iOS, Android, and Edge ASICs.

toc::[]

== 1. Orchestration Authority

The Rhodium stack follows a strict hierarchy of concerns. This project strictly forbids the use of legacy Makefiles. 

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Tool | Domain

| **Justfile** | **Local Artisan**: Handles internal tasks, builds, and white-space enforcement. The modern, versatile equivalent to Make.
| **Mustfile** | **Global Authority**: The final word on multi-manager deployments and container layering.
|===

== 2. Universal Shell Support (The Universal 22)

Deployment logic is verified across 22 shell environments to ensure absolute portability on everything from Android handsets (`mksh`) to high-availability servers.

[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
| ash | bash | cmd | csh | dash
| elvish | fish | ion | ksh | **mksh**
| minix-sh | murex | ngs | nushell | oil
| powershell | **rc** | **scsh** | tcsh | tsh
| **yash** | zsh | | |
|===

== 3. Supported Deployment Routes

`nicaug` (Nickel-Augmented) interprets the `Mustfile` to generate these specific artifacts:

|===
| Target | Manager | Logic / Extension

| **Fedora Kinoite** | `rpm-ostree` | Atomic Layering
| **Debian/Ubuntu** | `nala` | High-speed Parallel Injection
| **Android/Termux** | `pkg / mksh` | Mobile-Edge Portability
| **macOS / iOS** | `Homebrew / IPA` | Formula/Cask Wrapping
| **Windows** | `Scoop / Winget` | User-space Manifests
| **Edge/Minix** | `Static Bin` | Dependency-free execution
|===

== 4. Getting Started

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Secure the Rhodium toolchain
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh

# 2. Local tasks via Just
just build

# 3. Global authority via Must
must deploy
----

== 5. Cookbook
Refer to link:cookbook.adoc[cookbook.adoc] for exhaustive recipes, including using **Nickel** as the configuration source of truth for both Authority (Must) and Artisan (Just).

_“Local tasks use Just; Global authority uses Must; Every permutation uses Nicaug.”_
