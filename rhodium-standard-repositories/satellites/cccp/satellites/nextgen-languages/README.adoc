= Next-Gen Languages

*A strategic ecosystem of experimental programming languages exploring emerging paradigms*

== Overview

This repository serves as the central hub for the Next-Gen Languages initiative—a coordinated effort to design and develop eight programming languages that collectively cover the full spectrum of modern software challenges, from AI-native development to formally verified real-time systems.

|===
| Language | Core Philosophy | Primary Paradigms | Key Features | Target Domain

| *Solo*
| Dependable foundation for systems programming
| Imperative, Concurrent, Contract-Based
| `effect`, `go`, `where { pre: ..., post: ... }`
| General Systems Programming

| *Duet*
| AI-assisted development (Neuro-Symbolic) for verifiable software
| Imperative, Contract-Based, Neuro-Symbolic
| `@synth`, `@verify`, `intent("...")`
| High-Assurance, AI-Assisted Systems

| *Ensemble*
| AI as a first-class, native component of the language
| Imperative, AI-as-Effect
| `ai_model {}`, `prompt {}`, `AI<T>` effect type
| AI-Native Applications, AI Agents

| *Phronesis*
| Formal, auditable specification of an agent's ethical framework
| Declarative, Logic-Based, Agent-Oriented
| `Agent.`, `Values:`, `EVALUATE(...)`
| AI Safety, Alignment, and Auditing

| *Eclexia*
| Sustainable Software Engineering through resource-first constraints
| Declarative, Constraint-Driven
| `(energy budget ...)`, `(resource ...)`
| Green Computing, IoT/Embedded, FinOps

| *Oblíbený*
| Provably secure, obfuscated code for hostile environments
| Turing-Incomplete (Deploy), Metaprogramming
| `(forbid recursion)`, `(bounded-for ...)`
| Secure Enclaves (HSMs), Critical Embedded

| *Anvomidav*
| Maximalist formal verification for hard real-time systems
| Functional, Concurrent, Formal (Linear/Session Types)
| `task @sched(EDF)`, `Linear<T>`, `Π (...) . T`
| Avionics, Autonomous Vehicles, Robotics

| *WokeLang*
| Human-centric programming focused on consent and well-being
| Imperative, Natural-Language
| `only if okay "..."`, `attempt ... or reassure`
| Education, Personal Scripting, Accessibility
