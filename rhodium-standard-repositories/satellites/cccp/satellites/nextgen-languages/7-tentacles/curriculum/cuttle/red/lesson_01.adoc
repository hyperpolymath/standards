== Welcome!

Hello, friend! I'm **Speedy Red**! I LOVE to race!

Today, we're going to learn how to zoom around a race track. Are you ready?

== What You'll Learn

* How to follow a path
* How to go fast (but not TOO fast!)
* How to recognize simple patterns

== Let's Play!

=== Activity 1: Follow the Path

See this track? It goes:

----
START → RIGHT → RIGHT → DOWN → FINISH
----

Can you trace the path with your finger?

**Speedy Red says:** "Great job! You followed the rules perfectly!"

=== Activity 2: Race Time!

Now let's race! Drag Speedy Red along the track.

[game]
--
type: drag-race
track: simple-oval
character: speedy-red
win-condition: reach-finish
--

**Speedy Red says:** "ZOOM! You did it! That was fast!"

=== Activity 3: Which Way is Faster?

Look at these two paths:

Path A: START → RIGHT → RIGHT → RIGHT → FINISH (3 turns)
Path B: START → RIGHT → DOWN → RIGHT → UP → RIGHT → FINISH (5 turns)

Which path is faster?

[quiz]
--
question: Which path gets you to the finish faster?
options:
  - Path A (3 turns)
  - Path B (5 turns)
correct: Path A (3 turns)
feedback: "Speedy Red says: 'You've got it! Fewer turns means faster racing!'"

== What You Learned (Don't Tell!)

You just learned that:

* Following rules gets you to the finish
* Shorter paths are often faster
* Patterns help you predict what comes next

**But shhh... we're just playing racing games!**

== Next Time

In Lesson 2, we'll race on DIFFERENT tracks! Each track has its own rules.

**Speedy Red says:** "See you at the next race! ZOOM ZOOM!"
