== Welcome to Juggling!

Hello, friend! I'm **Juggler Orange**! I keep things in the air!

Today, we're going to learn the basics of juggling. Don't worry - we'll start with just ONE ball!

== What You'll Learn

* How to catch and throw
* The rhythm of juggling
* Keeping track of timing

== Let's Play!

=== Activity 1: One Ball

First, let's practice with ONE ball. Easy!

[game]
--
type: single-ball
action: throw-catch
timing: slow
character: juggler-orange
--

**Juggler Orange says:** "Perfect! One ball is just: throw... catch... throw... catch!"

=== Activity 2: The Rhythm

Juggling has a BEAT. Like music!

----
🎵 THROW - wait - CATCH - wait - THROW - wait - CATCH 🎵
    1          2          3          4
----

Can you clap along?

type: rhythm-clap
beats: [1, 3]
tempo: slow

=== Activity 3: Time Your Throws

Now throw the ball in TIME with the beat!

[game]
--
type: timed-throw
target-beat: 1
catch-beat: 3
character: juggler-orange
mode: tutorial
--

**Juggler Orange says:** "Great timing! The secret to juggling is rhythm!"

== What You Learned (Shhh!)

You discovered:

* **Sequence:** Things happen in order (throw THEN catch)
* **Timing:** When something happens matters
* **Rhythm:** A pattern that repeats

**This is how computers do things one at a time - in sequence!**

== Next Time

In Lesson 2, we'll add a SECOND ball! Two things at once!

**Juggler Orange says:** "Keep all the balls in the air! See you next time!"
