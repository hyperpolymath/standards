== Welcome to the Magic Show!

Hello, friend! I'm **Magic Indigo**! I perform magical transformations!

Today, I'll show you how magic works. It's not really magic - it's RULES!

== What You'll Learn

* How transformations work
* Magic follows rules
* The same spell always does the same thing

== Let's Do Magic!

=== Activity 1: The Color Swap Spell

This spell changes colors!

----
🔴 → SPELL → 🔵
Red becomes Blue!
----

[game]
--
type: spell-casting
input: red-ball
spell: color-swap
output: blue-ball
character: magic-indigo
--

**Magic Indigo says:** "See? The spell ALWAYS turns red into blue!"

=== Activity 2: The Growing Spell

This spell makes things BIGGER!

----
🔵 → GROW → 🔵
(small)      (BIG)
----

[game]
--
type: spell-casting
input: small-circle
spell: grow
output: big-circle
character: magic-indigo
--

**Magic Indigo says:** "The grow spell ALWAYS makes things bigger!"

=== Activity 3: Predict the Magic

If the Color Swap spell turns RED into BLUE...

[quiz]
--
question: "What will this become? 🔴"
spell: color-swap
options:
  - 🔴 (stays red)
  - 🔵 (becomes blue)
  - 🟢 (becomes green)
correct: 🔵 (becomes blue)
feedback: "Magic Indigo says: 'Magic is predictable! The same spell always does the same thing!'"
--

=== Activity 4: Chain the Spells!

What if we use TWO spells in a row?

----
🔴 → COLOR-SWAP → 🔵 → GROW → 🔵
small red    →    small blue → BIG BLUE!
----

[game]
--
type: spell-chain
input: small-red-ball
spells: [color-swap, grow]
output: big-blue-ball
character: magic-indigo
--

**Magic Indigo says:** "Chaining spells creates new transformations!"

== What You Learned (Wizard's Secret!)

You discovered:

* **Transformation:** Turning one thing into another
* **Rules:** Every spell follows a pattern
* **Composition:** Combining spells creates new effects

**In programming, we transform data using functions - just like magic spells!**

== Next Time

In Lesson 2, we'll learn MORE spells and create our own magic tricks!

**Magic Indigo says:** "The real magic happens before the show begins! See you next time!"
