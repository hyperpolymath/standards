== Let's Get Tricky!

**Speedy Red says:** "Okay racer, today we're adding OBSTACLES! Things that block your path!"

Don't worry - I'll teach you how to spot them and zoom around them!

== What You'll Learn

* How to recognize obstacles
* How to choose a different path when blocked
* How to spot patterns in obstacle placement

== The Obstacles

=== The Rock 🪨

Rocks block your path. You CANNOT go through them.

----
START ═══🪨═══ FINISH
         ↓
    (must go around!)
----

=== The Puddle 💧

Puddles slow you down. You CAN go through, but it's SLOW.

----
START ═══💧═══ FINISH
         ↓
    (slow, but possible!)
----

=== The Boost ⚡

Boosts make you go FASTER! Always hit them if you can!

----
START ═══⚡═══ FINISH
         ↓
    (ZOOM! Extra fast!)
----

== Let's Play!

=== Activity 1: Spot the Obstacle

Look at each track. What's blocking the path?

[quiz]
--
question: "What obstacle is this? 🪨"
options:
  - Rock (blocks you)
  - Puddle (slows you)
  - Boost (speeds you)
correct: Rock (blocks you)
--

=== Activity 2: Navigate the Course

[game]
--
type: obstacle-course
track: mixed-obstacles
obstacles:
  - type: rock
    position: [3, 0]
  - type: puddle
    position: [5, 1]
  - type: boost
    position: [7, 0]
character: speedy-red
goal: fastest-time
--

**Speedy Red says:** "Go around the rocks, through or around puddles, and HIT those boosts!"

=== Activity 3: Pattern Spotting

The obstacles follow a PATTERN! Can you predict what comes next?

----
🪨 💧 ⚡ 🪨 💧 ⚡ 🪨 💧 ?
----

[quiz]
--
question: What comes next in the pattern?
options:
  - 🪨 (Rock)
  - 💧 (Puddle)
  - ⚡ (Boost)
correct: ⚡ (Boost)
feedback: "Speedy Red says: 'The pattern repeats! Rock, Puddle, Boost, Rock, Puddle, Boost...'"
--

=== Activity 4: The Big Course

Now race through a course with MANY obstacles!

[game]
--
type: obstacle-course
track: complex-mixed
character: speedy-red
goal: fastest-time
patterns: repeating
--

== What You Learned (Top Secret!)

You just learned:

* **Conditional logic:** IF rock THEN go around
* **Pattern matching:** Recognizing repeated sequences
* **Decision making:** Choosing the best path

**In computer science, this is called "parsing" - looking at something and deciding what to do with each piece!**

== Challenge: Create an Obstacle Course!

Design a course with:

* At least 2 rocks
* At least 1 puddle
* At least 1 boost
* A PATTERN that repeats!

== Next Time

In Lesson 4, we'll learn about TIMING - when to slow down and when to speed up!

**Speedy Red says:** "You're learning to see patterns everywhere! That's the racer's secret!"
