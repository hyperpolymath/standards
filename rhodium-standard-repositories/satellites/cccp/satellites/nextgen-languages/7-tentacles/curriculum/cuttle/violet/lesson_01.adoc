== Let's Play Fair!

Hello, friend! I'm **Teacher Violet**! I make sure everyone plays fair!

Today, we're going to learn about RULES - why we have them and why they matter!

== What You'll Learn

* What makes a game fair
* Why rules are important
* How to make good rules

== Let's Think About Fairness!

=== Activity 1: The Unfair Race

Imagine a race where:

* Player A starts at the finish line
* Player B starts at the beginning

  - No, it's NOT fair
correct: No, it's NOT fair
feedback: "Teacher Violet says: 'Right! Everyone should start at the same place. That's fair!'"

=== Activity 2: Make It Fair

Here's an unfair game. How do we fix it?

**The Game:** Whoever has the most candy wins!

**The Problem:** Some kids started with more candy than others.

[quiz]
--
question: "How do we make this fair?"
options:
  - Give everyone the same amount of candy to start
  - Let the person with the most candy always win
  - Don't change anything
correct: Give everyone the same amount of candy to start
feedback: "Teacher Violet says: 'Fair rules make better games for everyone!'"

Which of these is a GOOD rule?

[quiz]

question: "Which rule is GOOD for everyone?"
options:
  - "Only tall people can play"
  - "Everyone gets one turn"
  - "My friend always wins"
correct: "Everyone gets one turn"
feedback: "Teacher Violet says: 'Good rules include everyone and give everyone a chance!'"

=== Activity 4: Create a Fair Game

Let's make a simple game together!

[interactive]
--
type: rule-builder
game-name: "The Sharing Game"
rules-to-add:
  - "Everyone starts with 5 tokens"
  - "Take turns clockwise"
  - "Highest roll wins the round"
check: fairness-validator
--

**Teacher Violet says:** "Your rules are fair! Everyone has an equal chance!"

== What You Learned (The Teacher's Lesson!)

You discovered:

* **Fairness:** Good rules treat everyone equally
* **Purpose:** Rules exist to make things work well
* **Design:** We can CREATE rules that are fair

**In programming languages, the "rules" are called SYNTAX and SEMANTICS - they make sure everyone's code works the same way!**

== Next Time

In Lesson 2, we'll learn about what happens when people BREAK the rules!

**Teacher Violet says:** "Fair rules make better games for everyone! See you next time!"
