== Let's Build!

Hello, friend! I'm **Builder Green**! I love making things!

Today, we're going to build with BLOCKS. Small pieces make big things!

== What You'll Learn

* How small parts make bigger things
* How to stack blocks
* How to plan what you build

== Let's Play!

=== Activity 1: Stack Three Blocks

Let's start simple. Stack three blocks to make a tower!

[game]
--
type: block-stacking
blocks: 3
goal: vertical-tower
character: builder-green
--

**Builder Green says:** "Great foundation! A tower needs a base!"

=== Activity 2: Build a House

A house has parts: a base, walls, and a roof.

----
    🔺      ← Roof
   ━━━━
   |  |     ← Walls
   |  |
  ━━━━━━    ← Base
----

[game]
--
type: assembly
parts:
  - name: base
    shape: rectangle
    position: bottom
  - name: walls
    shape: square
    position: middle
  - name: roof
    shape: triangle
    position: top
character: builder-green
--

**Builder Green says:** "You built a HOUSE from three simple shapes!"

=== Activity 3: What Comes Next?

If we're building a tower, what order do we need?

[quiz]
--
question: "What do you build FIRST?"
options:
  - The top
  - The middle
  - The bottom (base)
correct: The bottom (base)
feedback: "Builder Green says: 'Always start with a strong foundation!'"
--

== What You Learned (Builder's Secret!)

You discovered:

* **Composition:** Big things are made of small things
* **Structure:** Parts connect in specific ways
* **Order:** Some things must come before others

**In programming, we build big programs from small pieces too - functions, modules, and components!**

== Next Time

In Lesson 2, we'll build something MORE complex - with MANY parts!

**Builder Green says:** "Let's build something amazing! See you next time!"
