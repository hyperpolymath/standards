== Welcome Back, Racer!

**Speedy Red says:** "You're back! Today we're going to race on DIFFERENT kinds of tracks!"

Each track has different rules. Let's learn them!

== What You'll Learn

* Different tracks need different strategies
* Some tracks are straight, some are twisty
* Choosing the right approach matters

== Let's Race!

=== Activity 1: The Straight Track

This track goes in ONE direction. Nice and simple!

----
START ═══════════════════════════════════════ FINISH
----

[game]
--
type: timed-race
track: straight-line
character: speedy-red
goal: fastest-time
--

**Speedy Red says:** "On a straight track, you can go FULL SPEED!"

=== Activity 2: The Zigzag Track

This track goes back and forth. You need to change direction!

----
START ═══╗
         ║
    ╔════╝
    ║
    ╚════════ FINISH
----

[game]
--
type: timed-race
track: zigzag
character: speedy-red
goal: fastest-time
--

**Speedy Red says:** "Zigzag tracks need quick turns! You have to slow down at corners."

=== Activity 3: The Spiral Track

This track goes round and round, getting smaller!

[game]
--
type: timed-race
track: spiral-inward
character: speedy-red
goal: reach-center
--

**Speedy Red says:** "Spiral tracks need patience. The path gets tighter as you go!"

=== Activity 4: Match the Strategy!

Match each track with the best racing strategy:

[matching]
--
items:
  - track: Straight
    strategy: Go as fast as possible!
  - track: Zigzag
    strategy: Slow at turns, fast on straights
  - track: Spiral
    strategy: Start fast, get slower and more careful
--

== What You Learned (Keep It Secret!)

Different problems need different approaches:

* Simple paths → Simple solutions
* Complex paths → Careful planning
* The "fastest" approach depends on the situation

**This is actually how computers pick the best way to solve problems!**

== Challenge: Design Your Own Track!

Draw a track for Speedy Red. Think about:

* Is it straight or twisty?
* Are there any loops?
* Where are the tricky parts?

== Next Time

In Lesson 3, we'll learn about OBSTACLES on the track!

**Speedy Red says:** "Different tracks, different tricks! See you next time, champion!"
