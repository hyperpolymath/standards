Hello, friend! I'm **Safety Yellow**! I keep everything in the right place!

Today, we're going to sort things by COLOR. Everything has a place!

== What You'll Learn

* How to identify colors

== What You Learned (Keep It Secret!)

You discovered:

* **Classification:** Grouping things that are alike
* **Categories:** Names for groups (Red things, Blue things)
* **Type checking:** Making sure something belongs

**In programming, this is called "type checking" - making sure you put the right thing in the right place!**

== Next Time

In Lesson 2, we'll sort by SHAPE! Not just colors!

**Safety Yellow says:** "Everything has its place! See you next time, organizer!"
