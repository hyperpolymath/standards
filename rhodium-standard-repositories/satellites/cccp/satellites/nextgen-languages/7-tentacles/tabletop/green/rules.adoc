2. Deal 7 cards to each player
3. Place remaining cards as draw pile

== How To Play

=== On Your Turn

1. **Draw** 1 card
2. **Build** 1-2 cards onto your structure
3. **Discard** to max hand size (7)

=== Building

Place cards following the placement rules:

* Foundation cards start your building
* Each layer must be supported by the layer below
* Invalid placements are returned to hand (lose your turn!)

=== Challenging

If you think another player made an invalid placement:

1. Say "Challenge!"
2. Check the placement rules together
3. **If invalid:** They remove the card, draw 2 penalty cards
4. **If valid:** YOU draw 2 penalty cards

== Scoring

== The Secret (Don't Tell the Kids!)

[NOTE]
====
*What they're learning:*

* **Hierarchy:** Some things must come before others
* **Parent-child relationships:** Roofs need walls, walls need foundations
* **Valid structure:** Not everything can connect to everything
* **Composition:** Big structures made of small parts

This is Abstract Syntax Trees!

// In code terms:
Building {
  Foundation [
    Wall [
      Window
      Door
    ]
    Wall [
      Window
    ]
  ]
  Roof [
    Chimney
  ]
}
