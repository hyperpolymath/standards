== Setup

1. Shuffle each deck (Suspects, Actions, Locations) separately
2. Draw ONE card from each deck *without looking*
3. Put these 3 cards in the Evidence Envelope - this is the SOLUTION!
4. Shuffle remaining cards together (15 cards total)
5. Deal evenly to all players (some may have more)
6. Each player looks at their cards - these are NOT the solution!
7. Give each player a Detective Notebook

== How To Play

=== On Your Turn

1. **Make a Guess:** Name a Suspect + Action + Location
   * "I think WHISKERS ate the cookies in the KITCHEN!"

2. **Clockwise Check:** Starting left, each player checks their cards
   * If someone has ANY of those cards, they show you ONE (secretly!)
   * Mark it off in your notebook - it's NOT the solution

3. **If No One Shows:** You might be right! (Or the cards are in the envelope...)

4. **Make an Accusation (Optional):** If you're SURE, accuse!
   * Check the envelope
   * RIGHT = You win!
   * WRONG = You're out (but keep showing cards to others)

=== Detective Notebook

Track what you learn:

----
SUSPECTS      | Mine | Seen | Not It
--------------|------|------|-------
🐱 Whiskers   |      |  ✓   |   ✓
🐶 Buddy      |  ✓   |      |   ✓
🐰 Hoppy      |      |      |   ?
🐸 Freddy     |      |  ✓   |   ✓
🦉 Oliver     |      |      |   ?
🐻 Bruno      |      |  ✓   |   ✓

(Same for Actions and Locations)
----

== Winning

First player to correctly ACCUSE wins!

* You must name the exact Suspect + Action + Location
* Check the envelope to verify
* If wrong, you're eliminated but keep playing to show cards

== The Secret (Don't Tell the Kids!)

[NOTE]
====
*What they're learning:*

* **Elimination:** If you see a card, it's NOT the answer
* **Deduction:** Logic narrows possibilities
* **Verification:** Checking the envelope = running a proof
* **Evidence:** Each clue is like an assertion

This is formal verification!

----
// In code terms:
assert(suspect != "Whiskers")  // You saw this card
assert(location != "Kitchen")   // Someone showed you
// By elimination, you prove the answer!

== Quick Reference

----
YOUR TURN:
1. Guess: WHO + WHAT + WHERE
2. Check: Others show if they have any
3. Mark: Cross off what you see
4. Accuse: When you're SURE!

SHOWING CARDS:
- Only show ONE card
- Show secretly (others shouldn't see)
- If you have multiple, YOU choose which

WINNING:
- Correctly accuse = WIN
- Wrong accusation = OUT

== Variants

=== Junior Mode (Ages 6-8)

* Use only 4 of each type (12 cards total)
* Show cards openly (everyone learns together)
* Cooperative: Team tries to solve it together

* Forces deeper deduction chains

=== Timed Mode

* If no one solves it, most eliminated cards wins
* Creates urgency!

=== Double Mystery
