*A rule-creation game for 3-6 players, ages 8+*

== Overview

Create rules, vote on them, and play a game with YOUR rules! But rules must be fair - unfair rules get vetoed!

*Players:* 3-6
*Time:* 25-35 minutes
*Ages:* 8+ (Cuttle stage)

== What's In The Box

* 50 Action Cards (things players can do)
* 30 Rule Cards (templates for rules)
* 20 Vote Cards (Yes/No/Veto)
* 10 Point Tokens (scoring)
* 1 Rule Board (displays active rules)
* Rules card

== Game Phases

The game has two phases:

1. **Rule Making** (10 min): Create and vote on rules
2. **Playing** (15 min): Play a game using YOUR rules

== Phase 1: Rule Making

=== Creating Rules

On your turn, propose a rule using a Rule Card template:

**Rule Templates:**
----
"When you [ACTION], you must [CONSEQUENCE]"
"Players cannot [ACTION] if [CONDITION]"
"[ACTION] gives you [REWARD/PENALTY]"
"The first player to [ACHIEVEMENT] wins [BONUS]"
----

**Example rules:**
* "When you draw a card, you must say 'thank you'"
* "Players cannot skip two turns in a row"
* "Helping another player gives you +1 point"

=== Voting

After proposing, everyone votes:

* **👍 Yes (Green):** Rule is good
* **👎 No (Red):** Rule is bad
* **🚫 Veto (Purple):** Rule is UNFAIR

**Voting results:**
* Majority Yes → Rule is ADOPTED
* Majority No → Rule is REJECTED
* ANY Veto → Rule is VETOED (discuss why!)

=== Veto Discussion

If someone vetoes, they must explain WHY it's unfair:

* "That rule only helps you!"
* "Some players can't do that!"
* "It makes the game not fun!"

After discussion, vote again. If still vetoed, rule is rejected.

=== Rule Limit

The game can have maximum 5 active rules.
If you want a 6th, you must REMOVE an existing rule first (vote to remove).

== Phase 2: Playing

Now play a simple game with YOUR rules!

=== Base Game

Without rules, the base game is simple:

1. Draw 1 card
2. Play 1 card (gain points equal to card value)
3. Highest points when deck empty wins

**Your rules modify this!**

=== Enforcing Rules

Everyone is responsible for noticing rule violations!

* **Violation spotted:** Player loses 2 points
* **False accusation:** Accuser loses 1 point
* **Rule is confusing:** Vote to clarify or remove

== Winning

Highest points at end of Play phase wins!

**Bonus:**
* +3 if one of YOUR rules was adopted
* +2 if you successfully vetoed an unfair rule
* +1 for each rule you followed perfectly

== The Secret (Don't Tell the Kids!)

[NOTE]
====
*What they're learning:*

* **Syntax:** Rules have structure (when X, do Y)
* **Semantics:** Rules have meaning and consequences
* **Fairness:** Good rules work for everyone
* **Governance:** Rules can be added, removed, changed

This is language design!

----
// In code terms (a simple DSL):
rule WhenDraw {
  trigger: "draw"
  action: print("thank you")
}

rule NoDoubleSkip {
  condition: player.skips >= 2
  prevents: "skip"
}

// The "veto" is like a type error:
// "This rule doesn't compile because it's unfair!"

== Quick Reference

----
PHASE 1: RULE MAKING
1. Propose a rule (use template)
2. Everyone votes: Yes/No/Veto
3. Majority decides (Veto = discuss)
4. Max 5 rules

PHASE 2: PLAYING
1. Draw 1 card
2. Play 1 card (points = value)
3. Follow ALL active rules!
4. Violations = -2 points

VETO = "This rule is UNFAIR"
- Must explain why
- Discuss and re-vote
----

== Rule Ideas

=== Fun Rules
* "Say 'beep' when you play a 5"
* "Stand up when you draw the last card"
* "Trade hands with the player across from you after round 3"

=== Strategic Rules
* "Lowest card each round gets +2 next round"
* "You can skip your turn to draw 3 cards"
* "Ties are broken by rock-paper-scissors"

=== Tricky (Often Vetoed!)
* "Only I can draw from the bottom" (unfair!)
* "Red cards are worth double" (unfair if one player has more!)
* "No talking" (might exclude some players!)

== Variants

=== Constitutional Convention
Each player secretly writes 3 rules. Reveal and vote on ALL of them. Creates wilder games!

=== Living Rules
Rules can be modified mid-game! Propose amendments at any time.

=== Competitive Rule-Making
Score points for rules that get adopted. Most adopted rules = bonus points!
