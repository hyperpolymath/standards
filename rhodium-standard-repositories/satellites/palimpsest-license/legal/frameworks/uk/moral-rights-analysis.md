# UK Moral Rights Analysis
## Palimpsest License Alignment

**Jurisdiction:** England, Wales, and Northern Ireland
**Statutory Basis:** Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, Part I, Chapter IV
**Last Updated:** November 2025

---

## 1. Introduction

This document analyses the alignment between UK moral rights law and the Palimpsest License's protection of emotional lineage, symbolic attribution, and contextual integrity.

### 1.1 Moral Rights Under CDPA 1988

Four distinct moral rights:
1. **Paternity right** (right to be identified) — s 77
2. **Integrity right** (right to object to derogatory treatment) — s 80
3. **False attribution right** — s 84
4. **Privacy right** (commissioned works) — s 85

### 1.2 Palimpsest License Moral Dimension

Beyond statutory moral rights, Palimpsest protects:
- **Emotional lineage:** Narrative debt and cultural context
- **Symbolic attribution:** Recognition beyond legal credit
- **Contextual integrity:** Preservation of interpretive frameworks
- **Cultural refusal:** Right to exclude exploitative uses

---

## 2. Paternity Right (Section 77)

### 2.1 Statutory Framework

**Scope:** Right to be identified as author or director

**Works Covered:**
- Literary works (except computer programmes, typefaces)
- Dramatic works
- Musical works
- Artistic works
- Films

**Assertion Requirement:** Must be asserted (s 78)
- In writing, signed by author
- In instrument of assignment/licence
- By public assertion

### 2.2 Identification Requirements (Section 77(7)-(8))

**Literary/dramatic works published:** Author's name on reasonable number of copies
**Musical works published:** Composer's name on reasonable number of copies
**Artistic works exhibited:** Clear and reasonably prominent identification

### 2.3 Palimpsest Enhancement

**Clause 2.3 Metadata Preservation:**
```
The Work must preserve all embedded metadata, including:
- Author attribution
- Emotional lineage markers
- Cultural context indicators
- Symbolic provenance chains
```

**Comparison:**
| CDPA s 77 | Palimpsest License |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Identification as author | Attribution + emotional lineage |
| Assertion required | Automatic through licence |
| Name only | Name + context + cultural markers |
| Enforcement: litigation | Enforcement: contract + moral claim |

### 2.4 Case Law

**Sufficient Identification:**
- *Sawkins v Hyperion Records Ltd* [2005] EWCA Civ 565
  - "Dr Lionel Sawkins" sufficient; full credentials unnecessary

**Assertion Methods:**
- *Harrison v Harrison* [2010] ECDR 12
  - Public assertion via website and promotional materials valid

**Reasonable Prominence:**
- *Keane v Gale* [2010] EWPCC 8
  - Context-dependent; small-scale publication requires less formality

---

## 3. Integrity Right (Section 80)

### 3.1 Statutory Framework

**Right:** Object to derogatory treatment of work

**Treatment Defined (s 80(2)):**
- Addition to work
- Deletion from work
- Alteration to work
- Adaptation of work

**Derogatory Standard (s 80(2)(b)):**
Distortion or mutilation of work **OR** otherwise prejudicial to honour or reputation of author/director

### 3.2 Judicial Interpretation

**Objective vs Subjective Test:**
- *Tidy v Trustees of Natural History Museum* [1996] EWHC Patents 5
  - Objective test: would reasonable person consider treatment prejudicial?
  - Author's subjective belief insufficient

**Degree of Prejudice:**
- *Pasterfield v Denham* [1999] FSR 168
  - Claimant must show prejudice to honour/reputation as author
  - Not general reputation or commercial interests

**Context Matters:**
- *Confetti Records v Warner Music UK Ltd* [2003] EWHC 1274 (Ch)
  - Vocal sample unauthorised use; integrity right engaged
  - "Treatment" includes incorporation into different work

### 3.3 Palimpsest Alignment: Metadata Stripping

**Scenario:** AI system removes emotional lineage metadata during training

**CDPA Analysis:**
- **Treatment?** Yes — deletion from work (s 80(2)(a))
- **Derogatory?** Arguable
  - Prejudicial to author's reputation as creator of culturally contextualised work
  - Removes symbolic attribution markers
  - Distorts interpretive framework

**Palimpsest Clause 2.3:**
- Contractual prohibition on metadata stripping
- Stronger than s 80 (no need to prove derogatory treatment)
- Breach = contract remedy + moral claim

### 3.4 Palimpsest Enhancement: Emotional Lineage

**Beyond Section 80:**

| Element | CDPA s 80 | Palimpsest |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Scope** | Distortion/mutilation/prejudice | Cultural erasure, narrative debt |
| **Test** | Objective (reasonable person) | Subjective + community standards |
| **Remedy** | Injunction, damages | Contract + ethical accountability |
| **Waivability** | Yes (s 87) | More difficult (public accountability) |

**Emotional Lineage Protection:**
- Protest songs: preserves political context
- Trauma narratives: protects vulnerability context
- Diaspora stories: maintains cultural specificity
- Mythological works: safeguards symbolic layers

### 3.5 Exceptions to Integrity Right (Section 81)

**Does Not Apply To:**
- Computer programmes
- Computer-generated works
- Works in newspapers/periodicals (some exceptions)
- Works modified to avoid legal liability

**Palimpsest Position:**
- No exceptions for computational use
- Applies to computer-generated derivatives
- Comprehensive protection

## 4. False Attribution (Section 84)

### 4.1 Statutory Framework

Right not to have work falsely attributed

**Duration:** 20 years after death (s 86(2))

**Actionable:** Statement that person is author when they are not

### 4.2 AI Attribution Challenges

**Generative AI Scenarios:**
1. **AI claims authorship:** No person to falsely attribute to
2. **AI output attributed to training data author:** False attribution
3. **AI output attributed to prompter:** Depends on creativity contribution

**Palimpsest Clause 1.2 (Non-Interpretive Systems):**
- Requires consent for NI systems
- Prevents false suggestion work is AI-authored
- Protects against human authorship erasure

### 4.3 Case Law

- *Clark v Associated Newspapers Ltd* [1998] 1 WLR 1558
  - False attribution must be clear and unambiguous
  - Reasonable reader test

---

## 5. Comparative Analysis: Moral Rights and Palimpsest

### 5.1 Inalienability

**CDPA Position:**
- Cannot be assigned (s 94)
- Can be waived (s 87)
- Waiver must be in writing, signed

**Palimpsest Position:**
- Licence terms not waivable by downstream users
- Cultural accountability persists beyond waiver
- Emotional lineage protection independent of legal enforceability

### 5.2 Duration

**CDPA Duration:**
- Generally: same as copyright (life + 70 years)
- False attribution: 20 years after death

**Palimpsest Duration:**
- Ethical obligations persist beyond copyright term
- Cultural debt concept transcends legal duration
- Symbolic attribution as cultural practice, not merely legal right

### 5.3 Enforcement

**CDPA Enforcement:**
- Personal representatives may enforce after death (s 95)
- Infringement: injunction, damages (ss 103-104)

**Palimpsest Enforcement:**
- Contract-based (licensee breach)
- Cultural community accountability
- DAO governance mechanisms
- Symbolic enforcement (public shaming, cultural exclusion)

---

## 6. Metadata Preservation and Integrity

### 6.1 Legal Status of Metadata

**Copyright Protection:**
- Metadata may be literary work if original
- *IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd* [2009] HCA 14 (Australian; persuasive)
  - Factual information in databases not protected unless original selection/arrangement

**Integrity Right Application:**
- Deletion of metadata = "treatment" (s 80(2)(a))
- May be derogatory if removes attribution/context

### 6.2 Technical Protection Measures

**CDPA Section 296ZG:**
- Protection for electronic rights management information
- Includes:
  - Information identifying work, author, owner
  - Terms and conditions of use
  - Identifying numbers or codes

**Removal/Alteration Offence:**
- Knowingly removing/altering without authority (s 296ZG(2))
- Civil remedy for copyright owner (s 296ZG(5))

**Palimpsest Metadata:**
- Encompasses emotional lineage markers (beyond s 296ZG)
- Symbolic provenance chains
- Cultural context indicators

### 6.3 GDPR Interaction

**UK GDPR and Personal Data:**
- Author names, biographical data = personal data
- Processing must be lawful (Art 6 GDPR)
- Special category data (Art 9) if revealing cultural/religious context

**Balancing Rights:**
- Copyright/moral rights vs data subject rights
- Legitimate interest basis (Art 6(1)(f))
- Derogations for artistic/literary expression (Data Protection Act 2018, Sch 2, para 26)

---

## 7. Cultural Heritage and Public Interest

### 7.1 Public Interest Defence

**No Statutory Public Interest Defence to Moral Rights:**
- Unlike defamation law
- Integrity right requires derogatory treatment proof

**Judicial Recognition:**
- *Ashdown v Telegraph Group Ltd* [2001] EWCA Civ 1142
  - Public interest may prevent copyright injunction (limited scope)

### 7.2 Palimpsest Cultural Heritage Protection

**Beyond Individual Moral Rights:**
- Collective cultural ownership
- Indigenous knowledge protection
- Diaspora narrative preservation
- Intergenerational accountability

**UK Law Limitations:**
- Individual author focus (Romantic author paradigm)
- Limited collective rights recognition
- No sui generis cultural heritage copyright

**Palimpsest Innovation:**
- DAO governance for collective works
- Cultural community standing
- Symbolic enforcement mechanisms

---
