Dear [Name],

I am writing to introduce the **Palimpsest License** project and explore potential [collaboration/consultation/partnership] with you on [specific area].

### Background: The Problem We're Addressing

Creative workers face unprecedented threats from AI:
- Their work is scraped for AI training without consent or compensation
- AI-generated content floods markets, devaluing human creativity
- Metadata stripping erases creator context and cultural meaning
- Current copyright frameworks inadequately protect against these harms

**Vulnerable communities most affected:**
- Writers of trauma narratives, diaspora stories, cultural heritage
- Individual creators without legal resources
- Marginalised voices whose work is exploited without recognition

### Our Solution: The Palimpsest License

We've developed a legally binding licensing framework that:

**1. Requires AI Training Consent**
- Distinguishes between legitimate uses (search, analysis) and exploitative uses (generating derivatives)
- "Non-interpretive" AI systems (those creating new content) require explicit permission
- Reverses current burden: creators opt-in rather than fighting to opt-out

**2. Mandates Metadata Preservation**
- Platforms and users must maintain creator attribution and context
- Prevents "metadata stripping" that erases cultural meaning
- Creates legal liability for context removal

**3. Protects Emotional Lineage**
- Extends beyond legal attribution to narrative intent
- Recognises trauma stories, cultural heritage require special protection
- Community governance for collective cultural assets

**4. Future-Proofs with Quantum-Resistant Traceability**
- Anticipates emerging technologies
- Ensures attribution mechanisms survive technological change

### Project Status

- **Version:** 0.4 in development (v0.3 deployed)
- **Jurisdiction:** Primary - Netherlands (Dutch law); Secondary - UK, Scotland; Applicability - International
- **Governance:** Palimpsest Stewardship Council (multi-stakeholder: creators, legal experts, technologists, cultural advocates)
- **Community:** Growing network of creators, developers, legal experts, digital rights advocates
