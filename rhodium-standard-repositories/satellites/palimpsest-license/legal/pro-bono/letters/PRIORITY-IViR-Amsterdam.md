Geachte Professor Hugenholtz, Professor Quintais, en IViR-team,
*(Dear Professor Hugenholtz, Professor Quintais, and IViR team,)*

I am writing to request IViR's expert guidance on the **Palimpsest License**, an innovative copyright framework governed by Dutch law that addresses creator protection in the age of AI. Given IViR's world-leading expertise in copyright law and the Dutch legal system, your input would be invaluable for ensuring this license's legal rigour and enforceability.

### Project Summary

The Palimpsest License is a layered licensing framework designed to protect creators from AI exploitation whilst maintaining principles of remix culture and legitimate reuse:

**Primary Legal Jurisdiction:** Netherlands (Auteurswet governs)
**Current Version:** v0.4 (in development)
**Governance:** Palimpsest Stewardship Council (multi-stakeholder model)

**Key Innovations:**
1. **AI Training Consent (Clause 1.2):** Requires explicit permission for "non-interpretive" AI systems (those generating creative derivatives)
2. **Metadata Preservation (Clause 2.3):** Mandatory retention of creator context and attribution
3. **Emotional Lineage Protection:** Extends beyond legal attribution to protect narrative intent and cultural context
4. **Quantum-Proof Traceability:** Future-proofing for emerging attribution technologies

### Why IViR's Expertise is Critical

**1. Dutch Law is Our Primary Jurisdiction**
The license explicitly states Dutch law governs. We require expert validation that Palimpsest complies with:
- **Auteurswet 1912** (particularly Articles 25-27 on moral rights, Articles 45c-45h on TDM exceptions)
- **Dutch Civil Code** (Burgerlijk Wetboek - contract law aspects)
- **EU Directives as transposed in Netherlands** (InfoSoc Directive 2001/29/EC, DSM Directive 2019/790)

**2. IViR's Unparalleled Copyright Expertise**
Your institute's research on:
- European copyright harmonisation (Prof. Hugenholtz's foundational work)
- DSM Directive implementation (Prof. Quintais's expertise on Articles 3-6, TDM exceptions)
- Creative industries and empirical copyright (Prof. Poort's research)
- Digital single market and platform regulation

...directly informs the challenges Palimpsest addresses.

**3. Policy Influence**
IViR's research influences EU and Dutch policymaking. Your analysis of Palimpsest could inform:
- EU AI Act implementation (transparency requirements, training data consent)
- Dutch Copyright Act potential reforms
- Platform regulation (DSA/DMA metadata requirements)

### Specific Legal Questions for IViR

We would be immensely grateful for IViR's input on:

#### A. **Auteurswet Compliance**

**1. Moral Rights (Article 25 Auteurswet)**
- Does Palimpsest's "emotional lineage" concept extend Article 25's paternity and integrity rights?
- Are our metadata preservation requirements consistent with Dutch moral rights doctrine?
- Can moral rights be waived or licensed under Dutch law in the manner Palimpsest proposes?

**2. Text and Data Mining Exception (Articles 45c-45h Auteurswet)**
- Does Palimpsest's "opt-in for non-interpretive AI" comply with Article 45d's opt-out mechanism?
- Can we require more restrictive consent than the TDM exception allows?
- What constitutes "machine-readable" opt-out under Dutch implementation?

**3. Economic Rights (Articles 1, 12-13 Auteurswet)**
- Are our derivative work restrictions (requiring consent for AI-generated derivatives) enforceable?
- Does Dutch law recognise "AI-generated derivative" as distinct from human-created derivative?
- Can we distinguish between "transformative" and "non-transformative" uses for licensing purposes?

#### B. **Contract Law Validity (Burgerlijk Wetboek)**

**4. Contractual Enforceability**
- Are Palimpsest's licensing terms valid contracts under Dutch civil law?
- Can we enforce metadata preservation requirements against third parties (platforms)?
- What jurisdiction/choice of law clauses ensure Dutch law governs internationally?

**5. Standard Form Contracts**
- Does Palimpsest risk classification as unfair standard terms (oneerlijke bedingen)?
- Are our restrictions proportionate and reasonable under Dutch contract law?

#### C. **EU Law Alignment**

**6. DSM Directive Transposition**
- Does Netherlands' implementation of Article 17 (platform liability) interact with Palimpsest?
- Can platforms be required to enforce Palimpsest's metadata preservation?
- How does Article 15 (press publishers' rights) inform our approach?

**7. AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689)**
- When AI Act applies (2025-2026), how will transparency requirements (Article 53) interact with Palimpsest's AI consent clauses?
- Can Palimpsest's traceability requirements complement AI Act obligations?

#### D. **Enforceability & Practical Implementation**

**8. Cross-Border Enforcement**
- How enforceable is a Dutch law license in other EU jurisdictions? UK? US?
- Should we create jurisdiction-specific versions or rely on conflicts of law principles?

**9. Platform Compliance**
- Can we legally require platforms (e.g., GitHub, Medium, Substack) to respect Palimpsest metadata?
- What technical/legal mechanisms ensure platforms don't strip licensing information?

### Proposed Collaboration

We would be honoured if IViR could engage in any of the following ways:

**Option A: Legal Opinion (Preferred)**
- Formal written opinion on Palimpsest's compliance with Auteurswet and Dutch law
- Identification of legal risks and recommendations for revision
- Timeline: 8-12 weeks (flexible based on IViR capacity)
- Compensation: Pro bono for public interest project; acknowledgment in all materials; potential co-authorship on academic publication

**Option B: Student Clinic Involvement**
- Supervised student research project analysing Palimpsest under Dutch law
- Students gain real-world IP experience; we receive thorough legal analysis
- Timeline: Academic semester (can align with IViR clinic schedule)

**Option C: Academic Research Partnership**
- Co-authored paper: "AI Training Consent and Copyright: The Palimpsest Approach"
- Empirical research on creator needs regarding AI protection
- Publication in leading journal (European Intellectual Property Review, IIC, etc.)
- Timeline: 6-12 months

**Option D: Informal Consultation (Minimum)**
- 45-60 minute video call to discuss key legal questions
- Informal written feedback on v0.4 draft
- Referrals to other Dutch law experts if IViR cannot engage directly

We are flexible and respectful of IViR's research priorities and capacity. Even minimal guidance would significantly strengthen this project.

### Closing

IViR's research has shaped European copyright policy for decades. The Palimpsest License addresses challenges that IViR scholars have identified - the inadequacy of current copyright frameworks for AI, the erosion of moral rights in digital contexts, the power imbalance between creators and platforms.

We would be deeply honoured to benefit from IViR's expertise and hope this project can contribute, in turn, to IViR's research agenda and policy impact.

Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to your response and hope to collaborate with the world's leading copyright research institute.

Met vriendelijke groet / With kind regards,

**P.S.** If this request is outside IViR's current capacity or focus, we would be grateful for any suggestions of Dutch copyright law experts who might assist, or advice on alternative approaches to ensuring Auteurswet compliance.
