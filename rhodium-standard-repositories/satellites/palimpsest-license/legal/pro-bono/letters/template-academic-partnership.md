**Subject:** Research Collaboration Opportunity: Palimpsest License for Creative Work in the Age of AI

---

Dear [Professor Name / Centre Director],

I am writing to introduce the **Palimpsest License**, an innovative legal framework for creative work that addresses critical gaps in copyright protection for the age of AI, and to explore potential collaboration with [Institution Name].

### Project Overview

The Palimpsest License is a future-proof, layered licensing framework designed to protect creators working with narrative, trauma, mythology, and symbolic expression. It specifically addresses modern challenges including:

- **AI training consent:** Explicit opt-in requirements for "non-interpretive" AI systems (those that generate derivative content)
- **Emotional lineage protection:** Preserving narrative intent and cultural context beyond mere attribution
- **Quantum-proof traceability:** Future-proofing attribution mechanisms for emerging technologies
- **Metadata preservation:** Mandatory retention of creator context and symbolic texture

**Current Status:** Version 0.4 in development
**Primary Jurisdiction:** Netherlands (Dutch law) with international applicability
**Governance:** Palimpsest Stewardship Council (multi-stakeholder model)

### Why This Matters

Current copyright frameworks inadequately protect creators from AI exploitation. The Palimpsest License fills critical gaps:

1. **AI Training:** Many jurisdictions allow text/data mining without consent; we require explicit permission for systems that generate creative derivatives
2. **Moral Rights:** Extends beyond legal attribution to protect emotional and cultural integrity
3. **Platform Accountability:** Enforceable metadata preservation prevents "metadata stripping" that erases creator context
4. **Global South & Marginalised Voices:** Prioritises protection for diaspora narratives, trauma stories, and cultural heritage

### Research Collaboration Opportunity

We are seeking academic partners to provide:

**[CHOOSE RELEVANT OPTIONS]:**

- [ ] **Legal opinion:** [Specific question, e.g., "Compliance with Dutch Auteurswet Articles 25 (moral rights) and 45c-h (TDM exceptions)"]
- [ ] **Comparative analysis:** [e.g., "Cross-jurisdictional enforceability across EU/UK/US copyright systems"]
- [ ] **Student clinic involvement:** Law students providing license review, case studies, or compliance research
- [ ] **Co-authored publication:** Academic paper analysing Palimpsest's approach to [specific issue]
- [ ] **Policy consultation:** Guidance on [specific policy area, e.g., EU AI Act alignment]

### What We Offer
