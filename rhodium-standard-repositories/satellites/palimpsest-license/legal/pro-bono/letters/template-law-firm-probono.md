**Subject:** Pro Bono Legal Support Request: Palimpsest License for Creator Protection in the AI Age

---

Dear [Pro Bono Coordinator Name / Practice Leader],

I am writing to request pro bono legal support from [Firm Name] for the **Palimpsest License**, a public interest project developing innovative copyright frameworks to protect creative workers from AI exploitation.

### Project Summary

The Palimpsest License is a legally binding framework that addresses critical gaps in creator protection:

- **Challenge:** Current copyright law inadequately protects creators from unauthorised AI training and derivative generation
- **Solution:** Layered licensing requiring explicit consent for AI systems that generate creative content
- **Impact:** Protecting vulnerable creators (writers, artists, musicians) and cultural narratives (trauma stories, diaspora experiences, heritage)

**Legal Jurisdiction:** Primary - Netherlands (Dutch law); Applicability - International
**Status:** Version 0.4 in development; seeking legal validation for public release
**Governance:** Palimpsest Stewardship Council (non-profit model)

### Why Pro Bono Support Is Critical

This is a **public interest project** with significant social impact but limited financial resources:

1. **Creator Protection:** Addresses exploitation of marginalised creators whose work is used in AI training without consent or compensation
2. **Legal Innovation:** Develops enforceable mechanisms for emerging AI/copyright challenges
3. **Cultural Heritage:** Protects diaspora narratives, Indigenous knowledge, and trauma stories from commodification
4. **Policy Influence:** Informs copyright reform and AI regulation debates globally

The project cannot afford commercial legal rates but requires rigorous legal review to ensure enforceability and compliance.

- Timeline: 10-12 weeks

**Option D: Limited Scope (5-10 hours)**
- Focused review of specific clauses [list specific clauses, e.g., "Clause 1.2 on AI training consent"]

## Alternative Approaches

- **Networking:** Request introductions to academic or other pro bono contacts

### If Firm Requires Formal Application:
- Request application form/process details
- Submit promptly and professionally
- Follow up according to their stated timeline
- Be patient - pro bono committees meet periodically
