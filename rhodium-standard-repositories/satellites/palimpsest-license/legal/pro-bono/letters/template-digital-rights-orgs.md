**Subject:** Advocacy Partnership: Palimpsest License for Creator Protection in AI Training

---

Dear [Organisation Name] Team,

I am writing to introduce the **Palimpsest License** and explore potential collaboration on creator rights and AI accountability. We believe [Organisation Name]'s work on [specific campaign/area] aligns closely with Palimpsest's mission to protect creators from AI exploitation.

### Project Overview

The Palimpsest License is a legal framework addressing a critical gap in current digital rights advocacy: **creator consent for AI training**.

**The Problem:**
- AI companies scrape creative works (books, articles, art, music) for training without creator consent or compensation
- Current copyright exceptions (e.g., EU TDM exception, US fair use arguments) inadequately protect creators
- Platforms strip metadata, erasing creator context and making attribution impossible
- Cultural narratives (trauma stories, diaspora experiences, heritage) are commodified without community consent

**Our Solution:**
- **Mandatory opt-in** for AI systems that generate creative derivatives ("non-interpretive" systems)
- **Enforceable metadata preservation** to prevent context stripping
- **Emotional lineage protection** beyond mere legal attribution
- **Community governance** model for collective cultural assets

**Status:** Version 0.4 in development; seeking digital rights community input

### Why This Matters for Digital Rights

This intersects with [Organisation Name]'s core issues:

**AI Accountability:**
- Establishes consent frameworks for AI training data
- Creates enforceable opt-out mechanisms (reversing current opt-in burden)
- Addresses power imbalance between AI companies and individual creators

**Platform Responsibility:**
- Mandates metadata preservation (platforms can't strip creator context)
- Requires platform tools to respect licensing choices
- Creates liability for platforms enabling license violations

**Freedom of Expression:**
- Protects marginalised voices (diaspora, trauma survivors, cultural communities)
- Prevents AI-generated content from drowning out human creators
- Preserves cultural narratives' integrity and context

**Privacy & Data Rights:**
- Treats creative metadata as creator data deserving protection
- Extends data protection principles to creative/cultural output
- Quantum-proof traceability for future privacy technologies

### Collaboration Opportunities

We propose exploring partnership in areas including:

#### 1. **Policy Advocacy (Primary)**

**[For EU-focused organisations: Bits of Freedom, EDRi, ORG]**
- **EU AI Act Implementation:** Inform how Article 53 (transparency) applies to training data consent
- **DSM Directive Review:** Advocate for creator-protective TDM exceptions (Articles 3-4)
- **Platform Regulation:** Include licensing metadata preservation in DSA/DMA compliance

**[For US-focused organisations: EFF]**
- **Fair Use Doctrine:** Argue AI training should not automatically qualify as transformative use
- **DMCA Reform:** Include metadata preservation in copyright reform advocacy
- **AI Regulation:** Inform federal/state AI bills with creator consent provisions

**[For international organisations: Article 19, Access Now]**
- **Global norms:** Establish international standards for AI training consent
- **Platform governance:** Multi-stakeholder frameworks including creator rights
- **Freedom of expression:** Balance AI innovation with creator voice protection

**Specific Asks:**
- Include Palimpsest principles in policy briefs and consultations
- Joint advocacy on AI training data consent frameworks
- Amplify creator voices in AI regulation debates

#### 2. **Technical Guidance**

**Ask:** Advice on technical mechanisms for enforceable metadata preservation
- How can platforms be required to maintain creator metadata?
- What technical standards enable AI systems to respect licensing choices?
- How do we create machine-readable opt-out mechanisms?

**Your Expertise:** [Organisation Name]'s work on [relevant tech area, e.g., "platform accountability, privacy-preserving tech"] directly informs these questions

#### 3. **Legal Analysis**

**Ask:** Review of Palimpsest's approach to:
- AI training as "use" requiring consent under copyright/contract law
- Metadata as protectable data under GDPR/privacy law
- Enforceability of licensing terms against platforms and AI developers

**Your Expertise:** [Organisation Name]'s legal team has deep expertise in [relevant area]

#### 4. **Community Engagement**

**Ask:** Introduce Palimpsest to creator communities, activist networks, and policymakers
**Offer:** Palimpsest can amplify [Organisation Name]'s campaigns to creative sector audiences

**Mutual Benefit:**
- Creators learn about digital rights beyond copyright
- Digital rights advocates understand creator-specific concerns
- Joint campaigns are stronger than separate efforts

#### 5. **Case Development**

**Ask:** Collaborate on strategic litigation if/when license violations occur
- Identify test case opportunities
- Provide legal analysis and amicus support
- Coordinate public messaging

**Timeline:** Medium to long-term (violations must occur first)

### Key Messages Across All Organisations

1. **Creator rights are digital rights:** This is not separate from your mission
2. **AI accountability:** You're already working on this; we add creator perspective
3. **Power imbalance:** Individual creators vs. AI corporations = David vs. Goliath
4. **Mutual benefit:** Creators strengthen your advocacy; you strengthen our legal strategy

### Potential Objections & Responses

**"This is copyright, not digital rights":**
→ Copyright is a digital rights issue when platforms strip metadata and AI companies exploit creators. You already advocate on platform accountability; this extends to creator protection.

**"We don't have capacity for new projects":**
→ Even minimal engagement (introductory call, informal feedback) would help. We're flexible and don't expect resource-intensive partnership unless strong mutual fit.

**"This conflicts with open access/remix culture":**
→ Palimpsest supports remix culture for human creators. Our focus is preventing AI exploitation, not restricting human creativity. We're aligned with Creative Commons principles.

**"AI training might be fair use/TDM exception":**
→ That's the debate we want to influence. Current exceptions are overly broad. Palimpsest offers an alternative: creator consent frameworks that balance innovation with exploitation prevention.
