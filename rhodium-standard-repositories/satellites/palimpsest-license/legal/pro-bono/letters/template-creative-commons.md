**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: Palimpsest License as Complementary Framework to Creative Commons

---

Dear Creative Commons Legal and Policy Teams,

I am writing to introduce the **Palimpsest License** and propose a collaborative relationship with Creative Commons. We see Palimpsest not as competing with CC, but as addressing distinct creator needs that fall outside CC's current scope - specifically, protection from AI exploitation whilst maintaining remix culture principles.

### Why We're Reaching Out to CC

Creative Commons has built the world's most successful open licensing framework. The Palimpsest License draws inspiration from CC's approach whilst addressing challenges that emerged after CC's foundational licenses were developed:

**Shared Values:**
- Empowering creators with clear, enforceable licensing choices
- Balancing openness with appropriate protections
- Machine-readable legal frameworks
- Global applicability across jurisdictions
- Community governance and transparency

**Distinct Focus:**
- **AI Training Consent:** Requiring explicit permission for AI systems that generate creative derivatives (beyond search/analysis)
- **Emotional Lineage:** Protecting narrative intent and cultural context (trauma stories, diaspora narratives, heritage)
- **Metadata Preservation:** Enforcing retention of creator context, not just attribution
- **Quantum-Proof Traceability:** Future-proofing for emerging technologies

### The Complementarity Argument

We believe Palimpsest and CC can coexist productively:

**Creative Commons excels at:**
- Broad adoption for public sharing
- Reducing friction in reuse and remix
- Well-established legal and technical infrastructure
- Global recognition and trust

**Palimpsest addresses specific gaps:**
- Works requiring stronger AI training protections
- Cultural/emotional content needing context preservation
- Creators wanting explicit interpretive consent
- Communities protecting vulnerable narratives

**Use Case Example:**
- **CC-BY-SA:** Academic papers, reference materials, most creative works
- **Palimpsest:** Trauma narratives, cultural heritage, works requiring AI training opt-in
- **Both:** Potentially dual-licensed where appropriate

### Partnership Opportunities

We propose exploring collaboration in several areas:

#### 1. **Compatibility Assessment (Priority)**
**Ask:** Technical review of whether Palimpsest can interoperate with CC licenses
**Questions:**
- Can works be dual-licensed (CC + Palimpsest)?
- Are Palimpsest's restrictions compatible with CC-BY or CC-BY-SA?
- How do our different approaches to derivative works interact?

**Timeline:** Initial assessment within 2-3 months
**Deliverable:** Compatibility statement for our documentation

#### 2. **Legal Framework Feedback**
**Ask:** Expert review of Palimpsest license structure
**Value to CC:**
- Identify approaches CC might learn from (metadata preservation, AI consent)
- Inform future CC license evolution
- Strengthen broader open licensing ecosystem

**Timeline:** Flexible, based on CC capacity
**Deliverable:** Confidential feedback or public commentary

#### 3. **Joint Advocacy & Education**
**Ask:** Coordinate on AI/copyright policy issues
**Shared Interests:**
- Informing AI Act implementation (EU)
- Advocating for creator-controlled AI training opt-outs
- Educating creators about licensing choices

**Timeline:** Ongoing, as policy opportunities arise
**Deliverable:** Joint statements, complementary advocacy

#### 4. **Technical Integration**
**Ask:** Guidance on machine-readable metadata standards
**CC Expertise:**
- CC REL (Rights Expression Language)
- Integration with platforms and tools
- Global adoption mechanisms

**Timeline:** Medium-term (6-12 months)
**Deliverable:** Palimpsest metadata compatible with CC infrastructure

#### 5. **Community Cross-Pollination**
**Ask:** Introduce Palimpsest to relevant CC community members/chapters
**Benefit to CC:**
- Understand creator needs CC doesn't currently address
- Feedback on whether CC should evolve to include AI-specific clauses

**Timeline:** Ongoing
**Deliverable:** Mutual community engagement

### What We Offer CC

This is not a one-way request. Palimpsest can provide value to CC:

1. **Field Testing:** Real-world data on how creators respond to AI-specific licensing terms
2. **Policy Intelligence:** Insights from creators concerned about AI exploitation (underserved by current frameworks)
3. **Jurisdictional Expertise:** Dutch law implementation (our primary jurisdiction) may inform CC's European work
4. **Academic Research:** Collaboration opportunities with IViR, Max Planck, and other institutions
5. **Acknowledgment:** Credit and citation of CC's inspirational role in our documentation

### Palimpsest Project Background

**Status:** Version 0.4 in development (v0.3 deployed, v0.4 enhances legal rigour)
**Governance:** Palimpsest Stewardship Council (multi-stakeholder: creators, legal experts, technologists, cultural advocates)
**Jurisdiction:** Primary - Netherlands (Dutch law); Secondary - UK, international
**Philosophy:** "License born not just from copyright, but from care. From narrative debt. From cultural refusal. From emotional fidelity."

**Key Differentiators from CC:**
- Opt-in (not opt-out) for AI training that generates derivatives
- Mandatory metadata/context preservation
- Emotional lineage protection (beyond legal attribution)
- Quantum-proof traceability mechanisms

### Specific Questions for CC

We would value CC's input on:

1. **Legal Compatibility:**
   - Can a work be dual-licensed under CC-BY-SA and Palimpsest?
   - Do Palimpsest's AI restrictions conflict with CC's "freedom to adapt" principle?
   - How should we communicate relationship to CC in our documentation?

2. **Technical Standards:**
   - Should we adopt CC REL or develop complementary metadata?
   - Can Palimpsest integrate with CC search/discovery tools?
   - What technical standards ensure interoperability?

3. **Community Positioning:**
   - How can we clarify that Palimpsest addresses different needs without undermining CC?
   - Should we cross-reference CC in our user guidance?
   - Are there CC community members who've expressed needs Palimpsest addresses?

4. **Strategic Alignment:**
   - Is CC considering AI-specific license modules?
   - Could Palimpsest inform future CC developments?
   - Are there opportunities for joint research or policy work?

### Proposed Next Steps

**Phase 1: Initial Dialogue (Weeks 1-4)**
- 30-45 minute video call with CC legal/policy teams
- Share Palimpsest v0.4 documentation for review
- Discuss compatibility and strategic fit

**Phase 2: Technical Assessment (Months 2-3)**
- CC technical review of compatibility
- Palimpsest adjustments if needed for interoperability
- Draft joint statement on relationship/compatibility

**Phase 3: Ongoing Collaboration (Month 4+)**
- Regular check-ins on policy developments
- Potential joint advocacy on AI/copyright issues
- Community cross-pollination

We are entirely flexible on timeline and scope. Even a single conversation would be valuable.

### Closing

Creative Commons transformed how creators share their work. We deeply respect CC's achievements and see Palimpsest as building on that foundation to address emerging challenges.

We are not seeking to replace or compete with CC, but to serve creators whose specific needs - particularly around AI and emotional/cultural content - require different protections whilst maintaining the spirit of openness and sharing.

Thank you for considering this partnership. We would be honoured to collaborate with the organisation that pioneered accessible, enforceable licensing for the digital age.

Respectfully,

## Customisation Notes

### Tone Considerations
- **Respectful:** CC is the established leader; acknowledge their expertise
- **Collaborative:** Emphasise complementarity, not competition
- **Humble:** Position Palimpsest as learning from CC, not challenging it
- **Specific:** Avoid vague "let's partner" - give concrete proposals

### Key Messages to Emphasise
1. **Not competing:** Different creator needs, different use cases
2. **Shared values:** Both empower creators, both oppose exploitation
3. **Mutual benefit:** CC learns about underserved creator needs, Palimpsest gains credibility
4. **Openness:** Transparent about our goals and limitations

### Potential Concerns to Address
**CC might worry:**
- Palimpsest fragments licensing landscape
- "Stronger" protections undermine open sharing ethos
- Confuses creators about which license to choose

**Our responses:**
- **Fragmentation:** We'll guide creators clearly on when to use CC vs. Palimpsest
- **Open sharing:** We support remix culture; our focus is preventing AI exploitation, not human reuse
- **Confusion:** We'll create clear decision tools and reference CC appropriately

### Follow-Up Strategy

**If No Response After 3 Weeks:**
- Follow up politely, acknowledging they likely receive many requests
- Offer to engage through different channel (Twitter/Mastodon DM to staff, attendance at CC Summit, etc.)

**If Initial Interest:**
- Schedule call quickly (within 2 weeks)
- Prepare detailed presentation and Q&A
- Have compatibility analysis ready
- Identify specific CC staff whose work aligns (check CC blog, publications)

**If Skepticism:**
