## Communication Principles

### All Outreach Should:
1. **Be concise:** Busy professionals - 250-300 words max for initial email
2. **Be specific:** Clear ask, not vague "please review"
3. **Show respect:** Acknowledge their expertise and workload
4. **Offer value:** What's in it for them? (research, impact, credit)
5. **Provide context:** Attach 1-page Palimpsest summary
6. **Set expectations:** Timeline, level of commitment

### Avoid:
- Mass email (personalise each one)
- Jargon without explanation
- Assuming familiarity with project
- Open-ended requests ("any thoughts?")
- Pressure or urgency without justification

---

---

## Contact Record Keeping

### For Each Contact, Track:
- [ ] Initial outreach date
- [ ] Response received (Y/N, date)
- [ ] Follow-up required (date)
- [ ] Outcome (partnership, referral, decline, no response)
- [ ] Next steps
- [ ] Key contact person

**Recommended Tool:** Simple spreadsheet or CRM
**Update Frequency:** Weekly
**Review Frequency:** Bi-weekly to adjust strategy

---

## Risk Management

### Potential Issues:
1. **No response:** Follow up after 3-4 weeks, then move on
2. **Decline/no capacity:** Ask for referral to colleague
3. **Conflicting advice:** Document all opinions, synthesise thoughtfully
4. **Slow response:** Maintain patience, academic/legal work is slow
5. **Over-commitment:** Don't accept more help than you can coordinate

### Mitigation:
- Cast wide net (don't depend on single organisation)
- Tiered approach (backup contacts)
- Clear project management
- Transparent communication about capacity
