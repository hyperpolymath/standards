## 6. Palimpsest License Alignment

### 6.1 Statutory Support

| **Palimpsest Provision** | **UK Statutory Basis** | **Section Reference** |
|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Attribution (Clause 2.3)** | Paternity right (moral right) | CDPA s 77 |
| **Integrity (Clause 2.3)** | Integrity right (moral right) | CDPA s 80 |
| **Metadata Preservation** | Electronic RMI | CDPA s 296ZG |
| **AI Training Restriction (Clause 1.2)** | Contract law + proposed TDM exception | (s 29B proposed); contractual freedom |
| **Licensing Terms** | Contract law | Common law (freedom of contract) |

### 6.2 Statutory Gaps

**No UK Statute Explicitly Addresses:**
- Emotional lineage protection (broader than statutory moral rights)
- DAO governance structures (unincorporated association under common law)
- Quantum-proof traceability (evidence law, not copyright-specific)
- Non-interpretive AI systems (category not defined in CDPA)

**Palimpsest Solution:** Contractual terms fill gaps; enforceable under contract law.
