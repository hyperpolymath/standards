## Template Follow-up Email

**Subject:** Following up: Palimpsest License Partnership Proposal

Dear [Name],

I am writing to follow up on our letter sent on [DATE] regarding potential collaboration between [ORGANISATION] and the Palimpsest License project.

We remain very interested in exploring how our work on creator rights, AI training consent, and cultural context preservation might align with [ORGANISATION]'s mission and initiatives.

Would you be available for a brief conversation to discuss potential areas of collaboration? We are flexible regarding format and timing.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Name]
Palimpsest Stewardship Council

## Notes and Observations

**Strategic Priorities:**
1. **Open source foundations** (CC, FSF, OSI) – Establish credibility and technical frameworks
2. **UK writer/journalist orgs** (NUJ, WGGB, Society of Authors) – Build domestic support base
3. **Standards bodies** (W3C, ISOC) – Develop technical specifications
4. **Press freedom orgs** (Article 19, CPJ, Index) – International human rights framing

**Potential Champions:**
- Organisations already working on AI ethics
- Those with existing creator rights initiatives
- Groups focused on minority/indigenous rights
- Standards bodies developing AI-related specifications

**Potential Challenges:**
- Resource constraints at smaller organisations
- Competing priorities around AI policy
- Scepticism about enforceability
- Resistance from organisations aligned with AI industry

**Adaptation Strategy:**
- Be flexible about collaboration formats
- Emphasise symbolic/advocacy value alongside legal enforcement
- Offer specific, actionable collaboration proposals
- Listen to organisations' own priorities and adapt accordingly

*This tracking document should be updated regularly as outreach progresses. All correspondence should be documented with dates, key points, and next steps.*
