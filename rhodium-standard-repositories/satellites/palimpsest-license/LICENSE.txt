PALIMPSEST LICENSE v0.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Palimpsest License v0.4 is a future-proof, layered licensing framework
designed for creative work in the age of AI. It protects creators who work
with narrative, trauma, mythology, and symbolic expression while addressing
modern challenges like AI training, emotional lineage, and quantum-proof
traceability.

Governing Law: Netherlands (Book 6, Dutch Civil Code)
Enforcement Venue: Scotland (via Hague Convention, 2005)
Binding Languages: Dutch (primary legal), English (informative)

Key Protection Mechanisms:
  - Clause 1.2: Non-Interpretive (NI) systems require explicit consent
  - Clause 2.3: Metadata preservation is mandatory
  - Emotional Lineage: Protects narrative intent and cultural context
  - Quantum-Proof Traceability: Future-proofs attribution mechanisms
