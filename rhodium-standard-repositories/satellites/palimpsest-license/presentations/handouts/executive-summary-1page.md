# Palimpsest License: Protecting Creative Work in the AI Age

**One-Page Quick Reference**

---

## What is the Palimpsest License?

The Palimpsest License is a future-proof, layered licensing framework designed to protect creative work—especially narrative, cultural, and symbolic expression—from AI exploitation whilst enabling ethical AI development through explicit consent.

**Born from care, not just copyright. From narrative debt. From cultural refusal. From emotional fidelity.**

---

## Four Pillars of Protection

### 1. **Emotional Lineage Protection**
Preserves narrative intent, cultural context, and symbolic meaning—preventing AI from "flattening" complex emotions into generic outputs.

### 2. **AI Consent Framework (Clause 1.2)**
Requires explicit, prior, written consent before AI systems can train on your work. Comprehensive AGI training consent template included.

### 3. **Quantum-Proof Traceability**
Synthetic Lineage Tags (SLTs) use quantum-resistant cryptography to ensure your work remains attributable even as technology evolves.

### 4. **DAO Governance Support**
First license to legally recognise Decentralised Autonomous Organisations and collective ownership for creative communities.

## Technical Innovation

- **AIBDP (AI Boundary Declaration Protocol):** Web-wide framework declaring AI usage boundaries via DNS, HTTP headers, HTML metadata
- **Synthetic Lineage Tags:** Machine-readable provenance metadata embedded in AI outputs
- **Interoperable:** Works with Dublin Core, Schema.org, Creative Commons, existing metadata standards

---

## Legal Framework

**Dual-Jurisdiction Model:**
- **Dutch Law (Substantive):** Strong IP tradition, EU compliance, forward-thinking AI regulation
- **Scottish Courts (Enforcement):** Digital rights expertise, Hague Convention international enforceability

**Enforcement Mechanisms:** Injunctions, damages, account of profits, specific performance, audit rights
