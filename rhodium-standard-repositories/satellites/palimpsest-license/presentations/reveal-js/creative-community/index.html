                    <p><strong>Timing: 2 min</strong> - Opening: "Your grandmother's stories, your poetry about displacement, your music that carries generations of pain and hope—these aren't just data. They're living culture. And AI companies want to feed them into machines without asking, without crediting, without understanding what they mean."</p>

                <div class="story-box">
                    <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">Amara, a Nigerian diaspora poet, published "Echoes of Displacement"—a collection exploring her family's forced migration during the Biafran war. It took years to write, filled with her grandmother's memories and her own grief.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Six months later, an AI chatbot was generating cheerful travel poems using her imagery, her metaphors, her pain—stripped of context, sold as content.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold;">She had no legal recourse. Traditional copyright didn't cover AI training.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>This Shouldn't Happen</h3>
                    <p>Your work deserves protection that understands not just ownership, but <strong>meaning</strong>.</p>

                <div class="visual-description">
                    Visual: Split scene. Left: Amara writing poetry by candlelight, emotional depth visible. Right: AI system churning out superficial content using her words, stripped of cultural context. Between them, a broken chain representing lost connection to meaning.

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Timing: 3 min</strong> - Emphasise emotional impact. This is real harm happening to real creators. Traditional legal frameworks inadequate.</p>
