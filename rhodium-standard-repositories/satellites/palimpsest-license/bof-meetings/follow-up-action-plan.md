## Risk Management

### Potential Risks and Mitigations

**Risk**: Low attendance at BoF sessions
**Mitigation**: Intensive pre-BoF outreach, strategic scheduling, compelling abstracts

**Risk**: Hostile reception or opposition
**Mitigation**: Q&A preparation, coalition building, addressing concerns proactively

**Risk**: Follow-up activities overwhelming small team
**Mitigation**: Prioritize actions, recruit volunteers, focus on high-impact activities

**Risk**: Standards process stalls or rejects proposals
**Mitigation**: Multi-venue strategy, iterate based on feedback, build political support

**Risk**: Lack of pilot deployment volunteers
**Mitigation**: Lower barriers (provide support), highlight benefits, create incentives

---

## Success Stories to Highlight

Document and share:
- Enthusiastic endorsements from attendees
- Commitments to pilot deployments
- Media coverage of BoF sessions
- Regulatory interest or citations
