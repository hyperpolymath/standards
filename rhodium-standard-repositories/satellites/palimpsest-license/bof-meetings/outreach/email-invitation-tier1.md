Dear [NAME],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out personally to invite you to participate in an upcoming Birds of a Feather session on the Palimpsest License framework at [CONFERENCE NAME] in [CITY, DATES].

## Why I'm reaching out to you specifically

Your work on [SPECIFIC WORK/EXPERTISE] has been invaluable to [RELEVANT COMMUNITY], and I believe your perspective would be crucial as we develop infrastructure for creative content attribution in the AI era.

Specifically, I'm hoping you can:
- [SPECIFIC ASK: e.g., "provide feedback on our DNS-based license discovery proposal"]
- [SPECIFIC ASK: e.g., "share your experience with metadata preservation challenges"]
- [OPTIONAL: "consider joining as a co-organiser or panelist"]

## What is the Palimpsest License?

The Palimpsest License addresses a critical gap: AI systems scraping billions of creative works without consent, attribution, or compensation. We've developed:

1. **DNS-based license discovery** - allowing AI scrapers to check permissions before fetching content
2. **HTTP header consent signalling** - distinguishing interpretive vs. non-interpretive AI use
3. **Quantum-proof attribution chains** - ensuring long-term traceability

The framework protects not just authorship, but emotional lineage and cultural context—especially important for diaspora narratives, cultural heritage, trauma testimony, and marginalized communities.

- Follow up if no response within 1 week
- Send 6-8 weeks before conference

**Example Customizations**:

**For technical expert (IETF)**:
"Your work on HTTP header specifications (RFC XXXX) is directly relevant to our consent signalling proposal. I'm hoping you can review our X-AI-Consent header design and identify any compatibility concerns."

**For policy expert (EuroDIG)**:
"Given your expertise on AI Act implementation, I'm particularly interested in your perspective on how our framework aligns with Article 53's training data transparency requirements."

**For creator advocate (RightsCon)**:
"Your advocacy for marginalized creators deeply resonates with our mission. I'm hoping you can help us ensure the Palimpsest License genuinely serves vulnerable communities and doesn't inadvertently create barriers."
