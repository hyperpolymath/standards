## Template 1: Tier 2 Targeted Invitation

**Use for**: Important stakeholders, potential pilot participants, relevant experts

**Subject**: Invitation: Palimpsest License BoF at [CONFERENCE] - [SPECIFIC TOPIC RELEVANT TO THEM]

---

Dear [NAME],

I'm writing to invite you to a Birds of a Feather session on the Palimpsest License framework at [CONFERENCE NAME] ([DATES], [LOCATION]).

Given your work on [RELEVANT AREA], I thought you might be interested in our approach to creative content attribution in the AI era. We're addressing the challenge of AI systems scraping creative works without consent, stripping metadata, and ignoring licensing terms.

**BoF Session**: [DATE, TIME, LOCATION]
**Topic**: [CONFERENCE-SPECIFIC FOCUS]

**What we're proposing**:
- DNS-based license discovery (autodiscovery before content fetch)
- HTTP headers for AI consent signalling (interpretive vs. non-interpretive)
- Quantum-proof attribution chains for long-term traceability

**Why this might interest you**:
[SPECIFIC REASON BASED ON THEIR WORK - e.g.:]
- Your work on [X] directly relates to our challenges with [Y]
- We're seeking feedback from [COMMUNITY] on [SPECIFIC ASPECT]
- Potential collaboration opportunity on [SPECIFIC PROJECT]

**More information**:
- Project website: https://palimpsest-license.org
- Session proposal: [LINK TO PROPOSAL]
- Technical docs: [LINK TO GITHUB]

If you're attending [CONFERENCE], I'd be delighted if you could join the session. If you can't attend but are interested in the work, I'd be happy to arrange a brief call to discuss.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like additional information.

Best regards,

## Template 2: Tier 3 Broad Announcement

**Use for**: General conference attendees, mailing lists, broad community

**Subject**: BoF Session: Palimpsest License - Creative Content Attribution for AI Era

---

Dear [COMMUNITY/CONFERENCE] Community,

I'm pleased to announce a Birds of a Feather session on the Palimpsest License framework at [CONFERENCE NAME]:

**When**: [DATE, TIME]
**Where**: [ROOM/LOCATION]
**Duration**: 90 minutes

**Problem**: AI systems scrape billions of creative works, stripping attribution and ignoring consent. Current infrastructure lacks mechanisms for license discovery, consent signalling, and metadata preservation.

**Proposed Solution**: The Palimpsest License framework provides:
1. DNS-based license discovery
2. HTTP header consent signalling
3. Quantum-proof attribution chains
4. Protection for emotional lineage and cultural context

**This session will**:
- Present technical proposals for community feedback
- Demonstrate DNS and HTTP implementations
- Discuss [CONFERENCE-SPECIFIC TOPICS]
- Gather input for [STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT / POLICY ALIGNMENT / PILOT DEPLOYMENT]

**Who should attend**:
- [AUDIENCE 1]
- [AUDIENCE 2]
- [AUDIENCE 3]
- Anyone interested in ethical AI and creator rights

**More information**:
- Website: https://palimpsest-license.org
- GitHub: https://github.com/palimpsest-license
- Mailing list: [CONFERENCE-SPECIFIC]@palimpsest-license.org

Looking forward to productive discussions. Please share with interested colleagues.
