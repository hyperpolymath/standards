## Content Calendar

### Pre-BoF Campaign (6-8 Weeks Before)

#### Week -6 to -8: Initial Announcement

**Mastodon Thread** (Example):
```
🧵 Thread: We're organizing BoF sessions on the Palimpsest License at upcoming tech conferences (IETF, RIPE, NANOG, RightsCon, CC Summit).

What's the Palimpsest License? A framework for protecting creative content in the AI era. Let me explain... 1/10

[Thread continues with:]
- Problem statement (AI scraping without consent)
- Technical mechanisms (DNS, HTTP headers)
- Rights protection (emotional lineage, cultural context)
- Governance (creator-majority council)
- How to get involved

#AI #CreativeRights #IETF #RightsCon #CreativeCommons
```

**LinkedIn Post**:
```
I'm pleased to announce our upcoming Birds of a Feather sessions on creative content attribution infrastructure at major tech and rights conferences.

The challenge: AI systems scrape billions of creative works without consent, stripping attribution and ignoring cultural context.

Our proposal: Technical standards (DNS-based license discovery, HTTP consent headers) + Rights-based governance (creator-majority council, emotional lineage protection).

Join us at:
- IETF [NUMBER] ([DATE], [CITY])
- RIPE [NUMBER] ([DATE], [CITY])
- [Additional conferences]

More info: https://palimpsest-license.org/bof

#AIEthics #CreativeRights #InternetStandards
```

#### Week -4 to -5: Deep Dives

**Twitter/X Thread Series**:
- Monday: Technical deep dive (DNS mechanism)
- Wednesday: Creator perspective (testimonials)
- Friday: Regulatory alignment (EU AI Act, DSA)

**Example Monday thread**:
```
How does DNS-based license discovery work? 🧵

Current problem: AI scrapers fetch content before checking licenses. Like breaking into a house to read the "No Trespassing" sign.

Better approach: Check before entering. DNS provides lightweight autodiscovery...

[Continues with technical details, diagrams, code examples]

#DNS #IETF #WebStandards
```

#### Week -2 to -3: Stakeholder Spotlights

**Mastodon/Twitter**:
- Highlight confirmed speakers/panelists
- Feature pilot deployment partners
- Showcase supporter organisations

**Example**:
```
Excited to announce @expertname will be speaking at our #IETF BoF on HTTP header extensions for creative content licensing.

[Expert's] work on [relevant topic] has been foundational to our approach. Looking forward to their insights on [specific aspect].

Session: [DATE, TIME, ROOM]
```

#### Week -1: Final Reminders

**All Platforms**:
```
📅 One week until our Palimpsest License BoF at [CONFERENCE]!

When: [DATE, TIME]
Where: [ROOM/LOCATION]
What: Creative content attribution for AI era

### During Conference

#### Real-Time Updates

**Twitter/X Live-Tweeting**:
```
Starting now: Palimpsest License BoF at #IETF[NUMBER]

Room is packed! 50+ attendees interested in creative content attribution infrastructure.

@speakername kicking off with problem statement: "AI systems are strip-mining the creative web"

[Continue with key quotes, photos, insights]
```

**Mastodon Updates**:
```
Great question from the audience at our #RIPE BoF:

"What about the privacy implications of attribution chains for activist creators?"

Our response: Privacy-by-design. Attribution can be pseudonymous or collective. Creators control metadata exposure.

This is exactly the kind of critical feedback we need. 🙏
```

**Photos and Visuals**:
- Room shots (with attendee permission)
- Whiteboard discussions
- Presentation slides
- Attendee engagement

**Guidelines**:
- Ask permission before photographing attendees
- Use CW (Content Warning) for photos on Mastodon
- Credit speakers when quoting
- Provide alt-text for images (accessibility)
