# 🏛️ Palimpsest Governance Model

> **Note:** This Markdown version is maintained for backwards compatibility. The canonical version is now [GOVERNANCE.adoc](./GOVERNANCE.adoc) (AsciiDoc format) for RSR Gold compliance.

The Palimpsest License is a living framework, governed by its community of creators, legal experts, and technologists. This document outlines the principles and processes for its stewardship and evolution.

## 1. The Palimpsest Stewardship Council

The Council is the primary governing body responsible for maintaining the integrity and future direction of the license.

- **Composition:** A rotating board of 7 members:
  - 3 x Creator Representatives (elected by the community)
  - 2 x Legal Experts (specializing in IP, Dutch, or Scottish law)
  - 1 x Technologist (specializing in AI ethics or decentralized systems)
  - 1 x Cultural Heritage Advocate
- **Term:** 2 years, with staggered terms to ensure continuity.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Ratifying new license versions.
  - Arbitrating high-level compliance disputes (as outlined in the Compliance Toolkit).
  - Overseeing the project's ethical framework.

## 2. Decision-Making Process

Changes to the license follow a transparent, structured process:

1.  **Proposal:** Any community member can submit a proposal via a GitHub Issue using the "Proposal" template.
2.  **Discussion:** The proposal is open for community discussion for a minimum of 30 days.
3.  **Council Review:** The Stewardship Council reviews the proposal and community feedback. A simple majority (4/7 votes) is required to move a proposal to the draft stage.
4.  **Drafting:** A working group is formed to draft the specific changes to the license text or documentation.
5.  **Final Vote:** The final draft is presented to the Council. A supermajority (5/7 votes) is required for ratification.

## 3. Amending the License (New Versions)

- **Major Versions (e.g., v1.0, v2.0):** Reserved for fundamental changes to the license's core principles. Requires a 90-day community review period and a 6/7 Council vote.
- **Minor Versions (e.g., v0.3, v0.4):** Used for adding protections, clarifying language, or adapting to new technologies. Follows the standard decision-making process.

Our governance model is designed to be **responsive, transparent, and creator-centric**.
