# Legal Vignette: Cross-Border Enforcement (Dutch Law, Scottish Courts)

## Scenario: International License Violation, Jurisdictional Complexity

**Original Work**: *Threads of Memory* (textile art series)
**Creator**: Fatima Al-Rashid (Syrian-Scottish artist, based in Edinburgh)
**Violator**: US-based home decor company "GlobalTextiles Inc."
**Jurisdiction**: Dutch substantive law, Scottish courts (per Palimpsest v0.4)
**Outcome**: Successful cross-border enforcement via Hague Convention

---

## The Facts

Fatima Al-Rashid fled Syria in 2014, resettled in Scotland, and became a textile artist creating works that blended traditional Syrian embroidery with contemporary themes of displacement, loss, and resilience.

Her series *Threads of Memory* consisted of 20 intricate textile pieces, each telling a story of Syrian refugees' journeys. She photographed the textiles and shared high-resolution images online under Palimpsest v0.4, making them freely accessible for education and solidarity while prohibiting commercial exploitation.

### The Violation

GlobalTextiles Inc., based in California, scraped Fatima's images and:
1. Printed them on mass-produced cushions, curtains, and wall hangings
2. Sold them through major retailers (Target, Amazon, Wayfair)
3. Marketed as "Exotic Middle Eastern Home Decor"
4. Stripped all attribution and cultural context
5. Made over $2 million in revenue

Fatima discovered this when a friend in the US sent her a photo: "Saw your art at Target!"

### The Jurisdictional Question

Fatima faced a complex legal landscape:

**Option 1: Sue in the US (where violator is based)**
- US courts might not recognize Palimpsest license
- US "fair use" doctrine is broader than UK "fair dealing"
- Expensive litigation (US lawyers, travel, depositions)
- Uncertain whether Scottish artist could access US courts easily

**Option 2: Sue in Scotland (where she lives)**
- Familiar legal system
- But can Scottish courts claim jurisdiction over US company?
- How to enforce a Scottish judgment in the US?

**Option 3: Use Palimpsest's specified jurisdiction—Dutch law, Scottish courts**
- Palimpsest v0.4 explicitly states: "Governed by Dutch law, disputes resolved in Scottish courts"
- Benefits: EU legal framework + UK courts + English language proceedings
- Challenge: Would US company recognize this jurisdiction choice?

Fatima chose Option 3, leveraging Palimpsest's carefully designed jurisdictional framework.

### The Legal Strategy

Fatima's Scottish solicitor built a multi-jurisdictional strategy:

**Step 1: Establish jurisdiction in Scottish courts**

**Grounds for jurisdiction:**
1. **Palimpsest License Clause 7.1**: "This license is governed by Dutch law. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of Scotland."
2. **Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements (2005)**: Recognizes party-selected jurisdictions
3. **Brussels Regulation (recast)**: EU rules on cross-border jurisdiction (applicable even post-Brexit for cases like this)
4. **UK-US legal cooperation**: Judgments can be enforced through bilateral mechanisms

**Filing:**
Fatima filed in the Court of Session (Scotland's supreme civil court) in Edinburgh. Jurisdiction argument:
> "The defendant, by using plaintiff's work licensed under Palimpsest v0.4, consented to Scottish jurisdiction per the license's explicit terms. The Hague Convention requires recognition of such agreements."

GlobalTextiles moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. **Motion denied.** The judge ruled:
> "Licensing terms constitute an agreement between parties. Defendant used the work and thereby accepted the license terms, including jurisdiction. Hague Convention supports enforcement. Motion denied."

**Step 2: Apply Dutch substantive law**

Fatima's case was governed by **Dutch copyright law** (per Palimpsest):

**Advantages of Dutch law:**
1. **Moral rights protection**: Dutch law strongly protects moral rights (attribution, integrity), even for commercial works
2. **Licensing enforcement**: Dutch courts enforce licensing conditions strictly
3. **Cultural context recognition**: Dutch legal tradition considers cultural and emotional harm in IP cases
4. **AI-ready framework**: Dutch law was updated in 2023 to address AI training consent

**Application to Fatima's case:**
- **Copyright infringement**: Unauthorized reproduction (clear violation)
- **Moral rights violation**: False attribution (implied GlobalTextiles created the designs) + derogatory treatment (reducing cultural art to "exotic decor")
- **License breach**: Palimpsest prohibits commercial use without consent, metadata stripping, and cultural context removal
- **Cultural harm**: Dutch law recognizes that stripping Syrian refugee context causes non-economic harm

**Step 3: Scottish court proceedings**

Trial in Edinburgh:

**Fatima's evidence:**
- Original textile photographs with metadata (timestamps, copyright notices, Palimpsest license)
- GlobalTextiles' product listings showing her exact designs
- Revenue figures (via discovery from Amazon, Target, Wayfair)
- Testimony about cultural significance of Syrian embroidery and refugee narratives
- Expert witness on Dutch copyright law

**GlobalTextiles' defense (failed):**
- **"Fair use"**: Judge ruled US fair use doesn't apply under Dutch law; Dutch law has narrower exceptions, none of which covered mass commercial reproduction
- **"We didn't know about the license"**: Judge ruled ignorance isn't a defense; images were clearly marked with license terms
- **"Syrian embroidery is traditional, not copyrightable"**: Judge distinguished between traditional techniques (public domain) and Fatima's specific creative expression (copyrighted)

**Judgment:**
The Court of Session ruled in Fatima's favor:
- **Copyright infringement**: Proven
- **Moral rights violation**: Proven
- **License breach**: Proven
- **Damages**: £500,000 (based on revenues, Dutch law's approach to calculating damages, and recognition of cultural harm)
- **Injunction**: GlobalTextiles must cease all production, sales, and distribution
- **Public apology**: Required to publish acknowledgment of violation

**Step 4: Enforcement in the United States**

Fatima now had a Scottish judgment but needed to enforce it against a US company.

**Enforcement mechanisms:**
1. **Hague Convention**: While the US hasn't ratified the 2005 Choice of Court Convention, bilateral UK-US legal cooperation exists
2. **State-level enforcement**: Fatima filed in California state court (where GlobalTextiles is based) to recognize and enforce the Scottish judgment
3. **Pressure on US retailers**: Amazon, Target, Wayfair are US-based; threatening them with complicity motivated compliance

**California court proceedings:**
GlobalTextiles argued the Scottish judgment shouldn't be recognized:
- **"Violated due process"**: Rejected. Judge ruled they had notice, opportunity to defend, and consented to jurisdiction via license
- **"Against US public policy"**: Rejected. Protecting artists from exploitation is consistent with US copyright values
- **"Damages too high"**: Rejected. California court found damages reasonable given revenues and harm

**California judgment**: Recognized and enforced the Scottish judgment.

**Result:**
- GlobalTextiles paid £500,000 (approx. $625,000)
- Destroyed all remaining inventory
- Sent cease-and-desist to retailers
- Published public apology in trade publications

Amazon, Target, and Wayfair removed all products and banned GlobalTextiles from their platforms.

## Legal Analysis

### Why Cross-Border Enforcement Worked

**1. Palimpsest's Jurisdictional Choice**
By specifying Dutch law (strong IP protection) and Scottish courts (English-language, accessible), Palimpsest created enforceable cross-border framework.

**2. Hague Convention Framework**
Choice of court agreements are internationally recognized, making jurisdiction selection powerful.

**3. Strong Evidence**
Fatima's metadata, timestamps, and documentation made infringement undeniable.

**4. Moral Rights Under Dutch Law**
Dutch law's robust moral rights protection gave Fatima remedies unavailable under US law alone.

**5. Retail Pressure**
US retailers' fear of complicity motivated compliance even before California enforcement.

### Jurisdictional Innovation: Why Dutch Law + Scottish Courts?

This combination offers unique advantages:

**Dutch Law (substantive):**
- EU member state with strong IP protection
- Progressive on digital rights and AI regulation
- Recognizes cultural and emotional harm in copyright
- Well-developed licensing jurisprudence

**Scottish Courts (venue):**
- English-language proceedings (lower translation costs)
- UK legal system (familiar to many Commonwealth and common law jurisdictions)
- Edinburgh is accessible (major international city)
- Scottish courts have experience with international IP disputes

**Combined benefit:**
- EU legal framework + UK procedural accessibility
- Avoids language barriers of purely Dutch proceedings
- Leverages both civil law (Dutch) and common law (Scottish) strengths

### Precedent for Palimpsest Enforcement

This case established:
1. **Palimpsest's jurisdiction clause is enforceable internationally**
2. **US companies can be bound by Dutch law and Scottish judgments via licensing**
3. **Cultural context stripping is legally actionable under Dutch moral rights**
4. **Cross-border enforcement is feasible, not just theoretical**

## Practical Lessons

### For Creators

**Do:**
- Include clear jurisdiction clauses in licenses
- Choose jurisdictions strategically (strong IP protection + accessible venue)
- Document everything (metadata, timestamps, license notices)
- Pursue international violators; cross-border enforcement is possible
- Use retail platform pressure (Amazon, etc.) as leverage

**Don't:**
- Assume international violators are unreachable
- Give up because violator is in another country
- Forget to register copyrights in key jurisdictions
- Neglect metadata (it's crucial evidence)

### For Violators (Warning)

**Don't assume:**
- "They're in another country, they can't sue me"
- "I'm in the US, foreign judgments don't apply"
- Licensing terms are unenforceable across borders
- Small creators won't pursue international enforcement

**Understand:**
- Palimpsest's jurisdiction clause binds you when you use the work
- Hague Convention and bilateral treaties enable enforcement
- Retailers will comply with foreign judgments to avoid liability
- Cultural harm is actionable in many jurisdictions

### For Retailers & Platforms

**Do:**
- Require sellers to verify licensing and copyright
- Remove products immediately upon credible infringement claims
- Cooperate with cross-border enforcement
- Implement automated license detection (flag Palimpsest, CC, etc.)

**Don't:**
- Claim "neutral platform" immunity for clearly infringing products
- Ignore foreign court orders
- Continue selling after receiving cease-and-desist
- Assume only US copyright law applies

## Discussion Questions

1. Should all licenses specify cross-border jurisdiction? Or should it be case-by-case?

2. Is Palimpsest's Dutch law + Scottish courts combination accessible to creators from Global South? Or does it privilege European/UK creators?

3. What if GlobalTextiles had been based in a country with weak IP enforcement (e.g., some parts of Asia)? Would enforcement still work?

4. Should there be an international treaty specifically for cultural appropriation in commerce? Or is copyright law sufficient?

5. If Fatima had been in the US and GlobalTextiles in the UK, would the result have been different? Does directionality matter?
