# Legal Vignette: The Metadata Stripping Violation

## Scenario: Clause 2.3 Breach - Metadata Preservation Violation

**Original Work**: *Finding Home* (photography series)
**Creator**: Amina Hassan
**Violator**: Stock photo aggregator "ImageVault"
**Legal Outcome**: Successful enforcement, damages, platform policy change

---

## The Facts

Amina Hassan, a British-Somali photographer, created *Finding Home*: a documentary photography series following refugee families resettling in the UK. Each photograph was licensed under Palimpsest v0.4 with extensive metadata:

```markdown
PALIMPSEST_ATTRIBUTION.md

Title: Finding Home - Photo Documentation Series
Photographer: Amina Hassan
License: Palimpsest v0.4

Cultural Context:
These photographs document refugee resettlement with dignity and consent.
Each subject signed release forms and reviewed their photos before publication.

Content Warnings:
Some images contain:
- Visible trauma responses
- Children in vulnerable situations
- Documentation of poverty and housing insecurity

Appropriate Uses:
- Educational contexts about refugee experiences
- Journalism covering migration and asylum
- Human rights advocacy
- Academic research on displacement

Prohibited Uses:
- Anti-immigrant political campaigns
- Commercial advertising unrelated to refugee support
- Stripping identity/context to create generic "sad people" stock photos
- AI training for facial recognition or border surveillance
- Usage that exploits trauma for aesthetic value without context

Attribution Requirements:
- Photographer: Amina Hassan
- Title: Finding Home series
- License: Palimpsest v0.4
- Context: "Documentary photography of refugee resettlement in the UK"
- Content warnings maintained in all uses
```

Amina published the series on her website and licensed select photos to reputable news organizations who respected the terms.

### The Violation

Six months later, Amina discovered ImageVault, a commercial stock photo aggregator, had:

1. **Scraped her photos** from news websites where they'd been licensed
2. **Stripped all attribution metadata**—photographer name, content warnings, cultural context
3. **Recategorized the photos** under generic tags:
   - "Sad Middle Eastern woman"
   - "Diverse urban poverty"
   - "Refugee crisis aesthetic"
   - "Emotional ethnic person"
4. **Sold licenses** for £50-200 per image
5. **Removed cultural context** entirely—no mention of refugees, consent, or documentary purpose

One photo—a Somali mother holding her daughter's hand in a cramped temporary housing unit—was being sold as "Stock Photo #847392: Urban Housing Poverty" with zero context.

### The Legal Response

Amina's solicitor sent a comprehensive cease-and-desist citing:

**1. Copyright Infringement**
- Unauthorized reproduction and distribution
- No license from Amina to ImageVault

**2. Palimpsest License Violation - Clause 2.3 (Metadata Preservation)**
- Stripped photographer attribution
- Removed cultural context ("refugee resettlement documentary")
- Deleted content warnings
- Eliminated licensing information

**3. Moral Rights Violation (UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988)**
- False attribution (implied ImageVault had rights)
- Derogatory treatment (reducing documentary work to generic stock content)

**4. Data Protection Violation (GDPR)**
- Subjects' faces are personal data
- Consent was specific to documentary use, not commercial stock licensing
- Processing data beyond consent scope

**Demands:**
1. Immediate removal of all *Finding Home* images from platform
2. Disclosure of all buyers/licensees who purchased the images
3. Contact information for buyers so Amina can enforce proper use
4. £10,000 statutory damages per image (5 images = £50,000)
5. Public acknowledgment of violation
6. Platform policy changes to prevent future metadata stripping

### ImageVault's Defense (Failed)

ImageVault's lawyers argued:

**Claim 1: "We obtained images from public news sites"**
**Response:** News sites had specific licenses from Amina. Your scraping violated those terms and exceeded their license scope.

**Claim 2: "Metadata stripping is standard practice in stock photography"**
**Response:** Standard practice doesn't override license terms. Palimpsest explicitly requires metadata preservation (Clause 2.3).

**Claim 3: "Fair dealing for commercial purposes"**
**Response:** There is no "fair dealing" exception for wholesale commercial redistribution. You're not commenting, criticizing, or transforming—you're reselling.

**Claim 4: "Users can find attribution elsewhere"**
**Response:** The license requires attribution to accompany the work. "Find it yourself" isn't compliance.

### The Settlement

Facing strong legal grounds, ImageVault settled:

**1. Immediate Compliance**
- Removed all images within 24 hours
- Provided full buyer list (12 purchases)
- Refunded all buyers and sent cease-and-desist on Amina's behalf

**2. Financial Remedy**
- £35,000 damages to Amina
- £5,000 to refugee advocacy organization

**3. Platform Policy Changes**
- Implemented metadata preservation requirements
- Added license detection system flagging Creative Commons, Palimpsest, and other non-commercial licenses
- Staff training on attribution and licensing
- Public statement about the violation

**4. Ongoing Monitoring**
- Quarterly audits for one year
- Amina's lawyer can inspect compliance

### Enforcement Against Downstream Users

Amina then contacted the 12 buyers who'd purchased her images:

**Case Study - Corporate Blog Post:**

A corporate diversity consultancy had purchased one image for a blog post about "workplace diversity." They'd used the photo (Somali mother and daughter) with no attribution, no content warnings, and no refugee context.

Amina's approach:
> "You purchased this photo from ImageVault, which obtained it illegally. The photo is licensed under Palimpsest v0.4, requiring:
> 1. Attribution to me and the *Finding Home* series
> 2. Context that this documents refugee resettlement
> 3. Content warnings
> 4. Non-commercial or journalistic use only (not corporate marketing)
>
> Your use violates the license. Please either:
> A) Remove the image, or
> B) Properly attribute, add context, add content warnings, and make a £500 donation to Refugee Action (as compensatory licensing fee)"

The consultancy chose Option B, transforming their generic "diversity" post into an informed piece about refugee employment barriers, with proper attribution and a donation.

**Case Study - Political Campaign:**

Worse, an anti-immigration political party had purchased an image for a campaign leaflet with text: "Stop the Refugee Crisis—Vote [Party]."

This was exactly what Amina's licensing prohibited. Her response:

> "Your use violates:
> 1. The Palimpsest License's explicit prohibition on anti-immigrant political use
> 2. The subjects' consent (they agreed to documentary use, not propaganda against themselves)
> 3. My moral rights as photographer (using my work to advocate against refugees is derogatory treatment)
>
> You have 48 hours to:
> - Destroy all printed materials
> - Remove digital versions
> - Issue public correction that this image was used without authorization
> - Cease and desist from all further use
>
> Failure to comply will result in immediate legal action and public exposure of this exploitation."

The party complied, facing potential GDPR violations (using refugees' images against their interests) and significant reputational harm if the story went public.

## Legal Analysis

### Why This Case Succeeded

**1. Clear License Terms**
Amina's Palimpsest metadata explicitly stated prohibited uses, making violation unambiguous.

**2. Clause 2.3 Enforcement**
Metadata preservation isn't a "nice to have"—it's a license condition. Stripping metadata breached the license, making all downstream use unauthorized.

**3. Multiple Legal Grounds**
- Copyright infringement (unauthorized reproduction)
- License violation (Palimpsest terms)
- Moral rights (UK law)
- Data protection (GDPR)

This multi-pronged approach made dismissal impossible.

**4. Documentary Evidence**
- Original files with metadata timestamps
- News organization licensing agreements
- ImageVault's own platform showing stripped metadata
- Screenshots of buyer uses

**5. Public Pressure**
When Amina shared the story on social media (after settlement), the photography and refugee advocacy communities rallied, creating reputational pressure beyond legal consequences.

### Precedent Set

This case established several important principles:

**1. Metadata Is Content**
Under Palimpsest, metadata (attribution, context, warnings) is inseparable from the work itself. Stripping it is modification, not neutral redistribution.

**2. Commercial Aggregators Are Liable**
Stock photo sites can't claim "neutral platform" status. They have responsibility to verify licensing and preserve terms.

**3. Downstream Users Aren't Innocent**
Buyers from unlicensed sources don't gain legitimate rights. They must comply with original license or remove content.

**4. Consent Scope Matters**
Under GDPR and Palimpsest, subjects' consent for one purpose (documentary) doesn't transfer to all purposes (commercial stock, political propaganda).

**5. Cultural Context Is Legally Protected**
The "refugee resettlement" context wasn't decorative—it was a license condition. Removing it violated the license.

## Practical Lessons

### For Creators

**Do:**
- Embed license metadata directly in image files (EXIF, IPTC fields)
- Use watermarks or visible attribution when publishing online
- Register important works with copyright offices for statutory damages
- Document everything: original files, timestamps, license terms
- Monitor reverse image searches quarterly

**Don't:**
- Assume attribution will be preserved voluntarily
- Trust platforms to respect licensing without technical enforcement
- Post high-resolution versions online without protection
- Neglect to read platform terms of service (some claim rights to user uploads)

### For Users

**Do:**
- Check image licensing before use (assume nothing is "free")
- Contact creators directly for permission when unclear
- Preserve all metadata when using licensed content
- Verify that your license source (stock site, etc.) actually has rights
- Budget for proper licensing—it supports creators

**Don't:**
- Assume Google Images results are usable
- Strip attribution "to make it cleaner"
- Use images outside their license scope
- Trust stock sites to have verified all uploads
- Ignore cease-and-desist letters (they're often legitimate)

### For Platforms

**Do:**
- Implement automated license detection (check for CC, Palimpsest, rights statements)
- Preserve metadata from original uploads
- Require sellers to verify they have distribution rights
- Respond quickly to takedown requests
- Educate users about licensing

**Don't:**
- Claim "safe harbor" for obviously unlicensed content
- Make it easy to strip metadata
- Ignore Palimpsest, Creative Commons, or other license markers
- Assume "publicly posted" means "we can sell it"

## Discussion Questions

1. Should metadata preservation be automatic in all image formats, enforced by software? Should editing tools refuse to strip attribution?

2. What if ImageVault had accidentally scraped the images via an automated system they didn't actively monitor? Does automation reduce liability?

3. The political party's use was clearly harmful, but it was also political speech (protected in many jurisdictions). Should Palimpsest restrict political use? Where's the line?

4. If a buyer unknowingly purchased an improperly licensed image, should they bear any responsibility? Or only the seller?

5. Should there be a public database of Palimpsest-licensed works to help users verify licensing? Who would maintain it?
