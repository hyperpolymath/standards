## The Story

Sarah Chen wasn't her real name—she chose it deliberately when publishing *After the Avalanche*, a collection of essays about surviving sexual assault and navigating the years of therapy, relationships, and self-reconstruction that followed. The title referred to both the traumatic event (which happened during a university ski trip) and the emotional aftermath: the overwhelming rush of grief, rage, and gradual healing.

She wrote the essays over five years, initially for herself, then for a small survivor support group, and finally for publication. The writing was raw, unflinching, and achingly hopeful. It detailed the assault, yes, but more importantly, it charted her path through EMDR therapy, somatic healing, reconnecting with her body, and eventually finding joy again.

Sarah knew her story would help others—it already had, in the support group. But publishing meant making it public, and she was terrified of losing control over how it would be used.

### The Licensing Dilemma

Her publisher suggested standard copyright ("All Rights Reserved"), but Sarah wanted the essays to be freely accessible to other survivors. She couldn't afford to give therapy resources to people who needed them most if they had to pay £15 for a book.

Creative Commons felt too open. CC BY would allow anyone to use her trauma narrative for any purpose, as long as they credited her. She'd seen survivors' stories turned into clickbait, trauma porn, or inspiration porn by wellness influencers who'd never experienced such violence.

A therapist friend mentioned the Palimpsest License: "It protects emotional lineage. Your story's meaning matters as much as the words themselves."

Sarah read the license terms and felt something unlock. Here was a framework that recognized:

1. **Her trauma narrative had context that couldn't be stripped away**
2. **AI companies shouldn't train chatbots on her healing journey without consent**
3. **Derivatives needed to preserve the emotional truth, not just the factual events**
4. **Attribution should honour survivors collectively, not just her individual story**

### Licensing the Work

Sarah published *After the Avalanche* under Palimpsest v0.4 with detailed emotional lineage documentation:

```markdown
## After the Avalanche - Trauma and Emotional Context

**Author**: Sarah Chen (pseudonym)
**Content Warning**: Sexual assault, PTSD, suicidal ideation, recovery
**Emotional Intent**: To offer hope and practical healing strategies to other survivors, while maintaining the complexity and difficulty of recovery (no toxic positivity)

### Appropriate Uses

- **Survivor support groups**: Free to photocopy and share with proper attribution
- **Therapist resources**: May be used in clinical settings to help clients
- **Academic study**: Analysis of trauma narratives, survivor literature, recovery frameworks
- **Derivative works by other survivors**: Adding your story to this lineage, creating dialogue
- **Translation**: Making this accessible in other languages while preserving emotional context

### Prohibited Uses

- **Clickbait or trauma porn**: Sensationalizing assault details without the healing context
- **Inspiration porn**: Using my story to suggest trauma "makes you stronger" without acknowledging the pain
- **AI training without consent**: Chatbots offering "advice" based on my experience without understanding trauma-informed care
- **Commercial exploitation**: Wellness influencers packaging my healing journey as a product
- **Perpetrator narratives**: Anyone accused of sexual violence using my story to excuse or minimize harm
- **Stripping cultural context**: My experience as a British-Chinese woman is not incidental

### Attribution Requirements

Please credit:
- "Sarah Chen" (my chosen name for this work)
- *After the Avalanche* (title)
- "In solidarity with all survivors—named and unnamed" (collective attribution)
- Content warnings appropriate to the excerpt used

You do NOT need to credit my legal name (which I'm keeping private for safety).

### The Impact

Within three months of publication, *After the Avalanche* circulated widely in survivor communities. Support groups photocopied chapters. Therapists recommended it to clients. University gender studies courses assigned it.

A survivor named Priya reached out:

> "Your essay 'The Body Remembers' helped me understand my somatic flashbacks. I wrote a response essay from my perspective as a South Asian survivor, engaging with your themes. I've credited you under Palimpsest terms. Would you read it?"

Sarah did. Priya's essay was beautiful—it honored Sarah's work while adding crucial cultural context about how trauma recovery looks different across communities. Sarah shared it on her website, creating a "Dialogue" section where survivors could contribute responses.

This was exactly what the Palimpsest License enabled: **emotional lineage expanding, not being extracted**.

### The Violation

Six months later, Sarah discovered a "wellness coach" on Instagram who'd posted long excerpts from her essays (without permission) alongside advertisements for a £500 "trauma recovery masterclass." The coach—who had no therapeutic training—was selling a program that promised to "heal your trauma in 21 days" using "techniques like Sarah's."

The misrepresentation was dangerous. Sarah's essays explicitly rejected quick fixes and emphasized the long, non-linear nature of healing.

Sarah's lawyer sent a cease-and-desist citing three Palimpsest violations:

1. **Clause 2.3 (Metadata Preservation)**: The coach had stripped content warnings and cultural context
2. **Emotional Lineage Violation**: Misrepresenting Sarah's healing as quick/easy when her essays emphasized difficulty
3. **Commercial Exploitation**: Using trauma narrative to sell unqualified services

The coach removed the posts but argued she was "inspired by" Sarah's work and offered "transformative commentary." Sarah's lawyer responded:

> "Inspiration is permitted. Copying 1,500 words verbatim is not. More importantly, you distorted the emotional truth of the work—presenting trauma recovery as fast and formulaic when the original text explicitly warns against that. This violates the Palimpsest License's core protection: emotional fidelity."

The coach settled, issuing a public apology and donating £2,000 to a sexual assault survivor fund Sarah designated.

### The AI Question

A year after publication, Sarah received an email from an AI therapy startup:

> "We're building an AI companion for trauma survivors. Your book would be invaluable training data to help our chatbot offer empathetic responses. We'd credit you in our About page."

Sarah's immediate reaction: **No. Absolutely not.**

She replied:

> "My work is licensed under Palimpsest v0.4, which prohibits interpretive AI training without explicit consent. I'm declining consent for these reasons:
>
> 1. **AI cannot hold trauma ethically**: A chatbot can't understand when a survivor needs human intervention vs. automated support
> 2. **Liability**: If your AI gives harmful advice based on my experience, who's responsible?
> 3. **Decontextualization**: My healing strategies worked for me in my context—they're not universal scripts
> 4. **Exploitation**: You'd profit from survivors' desperation while I see no ongoing compensation or control
>
> If you genuinely want to help survivors, hire trained trauma therapists, not AI trained on our pain."

The startup founder, surprisingly, responded thoughtfully. They ended up hiring Sarah as a consultant to develop ethical guidelines for AI in mental health, paying her substantially and crediting her expertise.

## Key Takeaways

### For Trauma Survivors & Vulnerable Creators

1. **Your story's meaning is legally protectable**: Emotional context isn't "just feelings"—it's licensable content
2. **Pseudonyms are valid**: You can enforce a license without revealing your legal identity
3. **Free doesn't mean exploitable**: You can make work accessible while preventing commercial exploitation
4. **Community attribution matters**: Honouring collective survivor experiences is part of ethical storytelling
5. **You can say no to AI**: Training data consent is your right, and you can negotiate alternative relationships

### For Users of Trauma Narratives

1. **Content warnings aren't optional**: They're part of the work's metadata and must be preserved
2. **Context is protective**: Stripping cultural or emotional context can make trauma narratives harmful
3. **Attribution includes solidarity**: Credit the individual and the community they represent
4. **Transformation has limits**: You can't "transform" trauma into toxic positivity without violating emotional lineage
5. **Consent is ongoing**: Just because a story is public doesn't mean you can use it however you want

### For Platforms & Publishers

1. **Support pseudonymous licensing**: Legal enforcement shouldn't require revealing trauma survivors' identities
2. **Ambient attribution for excerpts**: When quoting trauma narratives, keep context visible, not buried in footnotes
3. **AI training requires explicit consent**: Trauma narratives are particularly sensitive and should never be in default training sets
4. **Restorative justice works**: The wellness coach violation led to community benefit, not just punishment

## Legal Analysis

### Palimpsest Clauses in Action

**Emotional Lineage Protection**: The core innovation here. Sarah's healing journey had emotional truth (recovery is long, non-linear, requires support) that the wellness coach violated by presenting it as quick and simple.

**Pseudonymous Attribution**: Palimpsest allows creators to enforce rights under chosen names, crucial for survivors who need privacy.

**Clause 1.2 (AI Consent)**: Sarah's refusal to let AI train on her trauma was legally protected, and she leveraged it into a consulting relationship instead.

**Clause 2.3 (Metadata Preservation)**: Content warnings are metadata. Removing them endangered readers and violated the license.

### Why This Matters for Vulnerable Creators

Trauma survivors, abuse survivors, people with stigmatized identities—these creators often need:
- **Privacy (pseudonyms)**
- **Control over context (content warnings, cultural framing)**
- **Protection from exploitation (commercial misuse)**
- **Community solidarity (collective attribution)**

The Palimpsest License provides all four, where traditional licenses provide none.

## Cultural Sensitivity Notes

This vignette illustrates:

- **Trauma-informed licensing**: Legal frameworks should protect psychological safety
- **Survivor autonomy**: Sarah controls how her story is used without gatekeepers
- **Community over individual**: Attribution honours all survivors, not just Sarah
- **Harm reduction**: Content warnings are ethical requirements, not suggestions

## Discussion Questions

1. Should trauma narratives ever be used in AI training, even with consent? What safeguards would be necessary?

2. How do we balance "sharing to heal others" with "protecting yourself from exploitation" when publishing trauma narratives?

3. Is it ethical for therapists to photocopy survivor narratives for clients without paying the author? How does Palimpsest's free-use-with-attribution address this?

4. What if another survivor wrote a response that Sarah found harmful or triggering? Can she revoke the license?

5. Should platforms like Instagram have automatic content warnings for trauma excerpts? Who decides what counts as "trauma content"?
