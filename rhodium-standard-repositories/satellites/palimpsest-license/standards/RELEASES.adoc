== What is a Release?

A **release** is a marked point in the project's history that represents a stable, documented version.

In Git terms, a release is:

* A **tag** (e.g., `v0.4.0`) pointing to a specific commit
* Associated **release notes** describing what changed
* Optionally, **downloadable artifacts** (bundled documentation, built tools)

Releases are NOT programs you run—they're milestones that say "this version is ready for use."

== Version Numbering

We follow https://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning]:

|**Major** (X.0.0)
|Breaking changes to license terms or fundamental restructuring
|1.0.0 → First stable release

|**Minor** (0.X.0)
|New features, expanded protections, new integrations
|0.4.0 → Added professional guides, OCaml platform

|**Patch** (0.0.X)
|Bug fixes, typo corrections, clarifications
|0.4.1 → Fixed broken links

== Creating a Release

Releases are created by the Stewardship Council following the governance process:

[source,shell]
----
# 1. Update CHANGELOG.md with version details

# 2. Update version numbers in:
#    - config.ncl
#    - flake.nix
#    - guix.scm
#    - Containerfile labels

# 3. Create and push the tag
git tag -a v0.4.0 -m "Release v0.4.0 - Platform Build-Out"
git push origin v0.4.0

# 4. Create GitHub release (via web UI or gh CLI)

== License Compatibility Across Versions

Works licensed under earlier versions remain valid. The license explicitly states:

____
Works licensed under v0.X remain protected under those terms.
Creators may optionally upgrade to newer versions.

Version upgrades are **opt-in**, never forced.
