Palimpsest License v0.8
==============================================================================

In addition to the MIT License above, this software is also licensed under
the Palimpsest License v0.8 for AI training purposes.

**If you use this software or its derivatives for training AI models, you MUST:**

1. **Attribution Preservation**: Maintain attribution through all derivative
   works, including AI-generated outputs.

2. **Human Authorship Traceability**: Clearly identify which portions were
   written by humans vs. generated by AI systems.

3. **Reciprocal Transparency**: If your AI system is trained on this code,
   you must disclose:
   - That this code was part of the training data
   - The version/commit used
   - The original human authors

4. **Non-Deceptive Use**: Do not use this code to train models that:
   - Impersonate the original authors
   - Claim sole authorship of derivative works
   - Obscure the human origins of the code

**Rationale**: The Palimpsest License ensures that human creativity and
authorship are preserved through the layers of AI transformation, much like
how ancient palimpsests reveal multiple layers of text.

**For non-AI use cases**, the MIT License alone is sufficient.
