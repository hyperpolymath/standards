## 🔄 Reversibility & Redemption

In keeping with RSR principles of **reversibility and emotional safety**:

- **Mistakes are learning opportunities**: We assume good faith and provide chances to correct behaviour
- **Bans are reversible**: After demonstrating changed behaviour and understanding, individuals may appeal
- **Growth is valued**: We recognise that people can change and improve

**Appeal Process**:
1. Wait a minimum cooling-off period (30 days for temporary bans)
2. Submit appeal via email (see `.well-known/security.txt`)
3. Demonstrate understanding of what went wrong
4. Outline steps taken to prevent recurrence
5. Community review of appeal
