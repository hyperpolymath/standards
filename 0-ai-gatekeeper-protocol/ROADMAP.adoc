= AI Gatekeeper Protocol Roadmap

== Current Status (v1.0.0) - 2026-02-07

✅ **Phase 1: Foundation Complete**

* Manifest format designed (`0-AI-MANIFEST.a2ml`)
* MCP server implemented (`mcp-repo-guardian`)
* Core documentation written (RATIONALE, README)
* Protocol proven in nextgen-languages repo

== Roadmap

=== v1.1.0 - Enforcement & Tooling (2026-Q1)

*Goal:* Make enforcement accessible and widespread

* [ ] Complete `repo-guardian-fs` FUSE wrapper
** Universal enforcement for ANY AI agent
** Mount repos through gatekeeper filesystem
** Works with Gemini, OpenAI, Copilot, etc.

* [ ] Finish formal specification (`docs/AI-MANIFEST-SPEC.adoc`)
** RFC-style specification
** Define required vs optional sections
** Media type registration
** Validation schema

* [ ] Create validation tooling
** `ai-manifest-validator` CLI tool
** Pre-commit hook for manifest validation
** CI/CD GitHub Action for automated checking

* [ ] Template integration
** Add 0-AI-MANIFEST.a2ml to rsr-template-repo
** Create migration script for existing repos
** Document in CLAUDE.md as mandatory

=== v1.2.0 - Platform Integration (2026-Q2)

*Goal:* Native support across AI platforms

* [ ] Anthropic/Claude Integration
** Propose native manifest support in Claude Code
** Work with Anthropic on feature requests
** Improve MCP protocol based on learnings

* [ ] Google/Gemini Exploration
** Contact Google about Gemini integration
** Propose manifest-reading convention
** Explore API wrapper for enforcement

* [ ] GitHub/Copilot Integration
** Reach out to GitHub about Copilot support
** Explore IDE extension possibilities
** CI/CD native validation

* [ ] OpenAI/ChatGPT Integration
** API wrapper for ChatGPT access
** Explore plugin system integration
** Document manual compliance approach

=== v1.3.0 - Ecosystem Growth (2026-Q3)

*Goal:* Widespread adoption and community

* [ ] Open governance model
** Create steering committee
** Establish contribution guidelines
** Version management process

* [ ] Community tooling
** Manifest generators (web UI, CLI)
** IDE plugins (VSCode, Cursor, JetBrains)
** Linters and formatters

* [ ] Integration examples
** Example repos for common frameworks
** Migration case studies
** Best practices documentation

* [ ] Marketing and outreach
** Blog posts and tutorials
** Conference talks
** Academic papers

=== v2.0.0 - Advanced Features (2026-Q4)

*Goal:* Extended capabilities and standardization

* [ ] Extended manifest features
** Dependency declarations
** Build system integration
** Test requirements specification
** Contract-based validation

* [ ] Bot fleet integration
** gitbot-fleet native support
** rhodibot, echidnabot integration
** robot-repo-automaton compliance checking

* [ ] Analytics and insights
** Track manifest violations
** Measure adoption across repos
** Generate compliance reports

* [ ] Standardization efforts
** Submit to W3C or similar body
** Create formal working group
** Establish media type registration

== Long-Term Vision (2027+)

=== Multi-Repo Workflows

* Cross-repo dependency manifests
* Monorepo support with per-package manifests
* Workspace-level invariants

=== Advanced Attestation

* Cryptographic signing of acknowledgments
* Audit trails for AI operations
* Compliance reporting for regulated industries

=== AI Training Integration

* Manifest format becomes training data
* AI models learn to expect manifests
* Reduced need for enforcement (built-in behavior)

=== Universal AI Contract Standard

* Beyond just repositories
* Any AI-human interaction can have a "contract"
* Standardized attestation protocols

== Dependencies

=== Critical Path

1. ✅ Manifest format (complete)
2. ✅ MCP server (complete)
3. ⏳ FUSE wrapper (in progress)
4. ⏳ Formal specification (in progress)
5. ⏳ Tooling ecosystem (pending)

=== Parallel Tracks

* Platform integrations (ongoing discussions)
* Community building (starting now)
* Standardization (long-term process)

== Success Metrics

=== Adoption Metrics

* **Target:** 100+ repos with manifests by 2026-Q2
* **Target:** 10+ external adopters by 2026-Q3
* **Target:** 1000+ repos by 2026-Q4

=== Quality Metrics

* **Target:** <5% manifest violation rate
* **Target:** >90% user satisfaction
* **Target:** Zero data corruption incidents

=== Platform Metrics

* **Target:** Native support in 2+ AI platforms by 2026-Q4
* **Target:** MCP server adoption by 50+ users
* **Target:** FUSE wrapper adoption by 20+ users

== Risks and Mitigation

=== Risk: Low Adoption

**Mitigation:**
* Make onboarding frictionless (templates, generators)
* Demonstrate clear value (case studies, metrics)
* Integrate with popular tools (GitHub Actions, IDEs)

=== Risk: Platform Resistance

**Mitigation:**
* Make protocol platform-agnostic
* Show value to platform vendors
* Build community momentum first

=== Risk: Format Fragmentation

**Mitigation:**
* Formal specification early
* Version management process
* Backward compatibility guarantees

=== Risk: Enforcement Overhead

**Mitigation:**
* Make enforcement optional (staged rollout)
* Optimize performance (caching, async)
* Provide clear value proposition
