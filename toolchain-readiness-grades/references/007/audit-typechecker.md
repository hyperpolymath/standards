| Context | Discourse-bound context tracking |
| Type System | Type system agnostic |
| Diagnostics | Error reporting tailored to active type system |
| Features | Generics/traits/higher-kinded types |

## Should Have

| Category | Feature |
|---|---|
| Interop | Cross-type-system interop |
| Selection | Dynamic semantic selection (@dynamic) |
