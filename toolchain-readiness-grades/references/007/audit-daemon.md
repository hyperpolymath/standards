# 007 MK2 Audit Target: Language Toolchain Daemon
# Status: DESIGN TARGET — check against actual implementation

## Must Have

| Dimension | Feature |
|---|---|
| Purpose | Clearly defines its role (compilation, translation, linting, dependency management) |
| Error Handling | Gracefully handles syntax errors, missing files, and tool failures |
| Logging | Logs all critical actions, errors, and warnings to structured file or stdout |
| Resources | Enforces CPU/RAM limits to prevent resource exhaustion |
| Isolation | Runs language tools in isolated subprocesses or containers |
| Exit Codes | Returns meaningful exit codes (0=success, 1=warning, 2=error) |
| Configuration | Validates and sanitizes all input (file paths, CLI args) |
| Dependencies | Checks for required language tool versions |

## Should Have

| Dimension | Feature |
|---|---|
| Performance | Benchmarks toolchain steps and optimizes hot paths |
| Feedback | Provides clear, human-readable error messages |
| Parallelism | Supports parallel execution where possible |
| Dependencies | Tracks and visualizes tool dependencies |
| Idempotency | Ensures repeated runs produce the same output |
| Security | Restricts toolchain access to sensitive directories/data |
| Recovery | Allows reverting to previous toolchain state via snapshots |
| Portability | Works consistently across Linux/macOS/Windows |

## Could Have

| Dimension | Feature |
|---|---|
| Caching | Caches intermediate results (compiled binaries, parsed ASTs) |
| Interactive | Offers a REPL or interactive prompts for debugging |
| Extensibility | Allows custom plugins/hooks (pre/post-processing scripts) |
| Integration | Integrates with IDEs via LSP or CLI |
| Telemetry | Tracks anonymized usage metrics |
| Autoupdate | Automatically updates language tools to compatible versions |
| Multi-Tool | Supports multiple language ecosystems |
| AI | Offers AI-powered suggestions for fixes |

## Aspirational

| Dimension | Feature |
|---|---|
| Self-Healing | Automatically detects and fixes common toolchain issues |
| Predictive | Predicts toolchain failures before they occur |
| Collaborative | Enables team-wide toolchain sharing/configuration via registry |
| Cloud-Native | Runs natively in cloud environments (Kubernetes, serverless) |
| Efficiency | Optimizes toolchain steps for minimal resource usage |
| Federated | Works across organizations/tools via open standards (LSP, WASM) |
| Ethics | Ensures language models/tools respect privacy and bias mitigation |

## Ecosystem Integration
- Package Manager: OPSM
- IDE: PanLL + Visual Codium (ENSAID)
