== Overview

This document outlines the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) registration requirements for the ECOSYSTEM.scm format specification.

The primary registration is for a new media type to identify ECOSYSTEM.scm documents.

== Media Type Registration

=== Registration Template

Following the template defined in RFC 6838 "Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures":

[source]
----
Type name: application

Subtype name: vnd.ecosystem+scm

Required parameters: N/A

Optional parameters:
  charset: If specified, MUST be "utf-8". ECOSYSTEM.scm documents
           are always UTF-8 encoded.

Encoding considerations:
  8bit. ECOSYSTEM.scm documents are UTF-8 text.

Security considerations:
  ECOSYSTEM.scm documents are declarative metadata in S-expression
  format. They do not contain executable code. However:

  - URLs within documents should be validated before dereferencing
    to prevent SSRF attacks
  - Parsers should implement depth and size limits to prevent
    denial-of-service through resource exhaustion
  - When embedding in other formats, proper escaping is required
    to prevent injection attacks

  See Section 9 of draft-jewell-ecosystem-scm for full security
  considerations.

Interoperability considerations:
  ECOSYSTEM.scm uses S-expression syntax, which is well-defined
  and has mature parser implementations in most programming
  languages. The format is designed to be round-trip safe.

Published specification:
  draft-jewell-ecosystem-scm (Internet-Draft)
  https://github.com/hyperpolymath/ECOSYSTEM.scm

Applications that use this media type:
  - Software development tools
  - Documentation generators
  - Dependency analyzers
  - Ecosystem visualization tools
  - IDE plugins
  - CI/CD systems

Fragment identifier considerations:
  N/A. No fragment identifier semantics are defined for this
  media type.

Additional information:

  Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
  Magic number(s): Documents typically begin with "(ecosystem"
  File extension(s): .ecosystem.scm (preferred), .ecosystem
  Macintosh file type code(s): N/A

Intended usage: COMMON

Restrictions on usage: N/A

=== Registration Type

This registration uses the **vendor tree** (`vnd.`) as appropriate for formats without IETF consensus.

Upon publication as an IETF RFC, the media type MAY be migrated to the **standards tree** as `application/ecosystem+scm`.

=== Structured Syntax Suffix

The `+scm` suffix indicates S-expression (Scheme) format. This is a de facto suffix used by the Lisp/Scheme community, though not formally registered with IANA.

[NOTE]
====
If the IETF approves a structured syntax suffix for S-expressions in the future, this registration should be updated accordingly.
====

== File Extension Registration

=== Recommended Extensions

[cols="2,3,2"]
|===
| Extension | Usage | Priority

| `.ecosystem.scm`
| Compound extension for clarity
| Primary

| `.ecosystem`
| Shorter alternative
| Secondary

| `ECOSYSTEM.scm`
| Repository root convention
| Filename
|===

=== Rationale

The compound extension `.ecosystem.scm` provides:

1. **Unambiguous identification** - Distinguishes from generic `.scm` Scheme files
2. **Editor support** - Allows editors to apply specific syntax highlighting
3. **Discovery** - Tools can glob for `*.ecosystem.scm` without false positives

== URI Scheme Considerations

No custom URI scheme is proposed. ECOSYSTEM.scm documents are identified by:

1. Standard file: URIs for local documents
2. https: URIs for published documents
3. The media type for content negotiation

== Future Considerations

=== Standards Tree Migration

If ECOSYSTEM.scm achieves IETF Standards Track status:

1. Media type would change to `application/ecosystem+scm` (no `vnd.` prefix)
2. IANA registration would be updated
3. Both media types should be accepted during transition period

=== Related Registrations

The STATE.scm sibling format may require similar registrations:

- `application/vnd.state+scm`
- `.state.scm` file extension

A unified family approach may be beneficial.

== Registration Process

=== Current Status

[cols="2,3"]
|===
| Item | Status

| Media type application
| **Draft prepared** - Awaiting I-D submission

| File extension
| **Community convention** - No IANA registration needed

| IETF Internet-Draft
| **Draft-00 complete** - Ready for submission
|===

=== Next Steps

1. Submit Internet-Draft to IETF datatracker
2. Request review from Applications and Real-Time Area (ART)
3. If accepted, proceed with IANA media type registration
4. Monitor for any required revisions during IETF Last Call

== Appendix: Alternative Approaches Considered

=== ISO Registration

ISO standards track was considered but deemed inappropriate because:

- ISO is primarily for industrial/engineering standards
- Long timeline (years)
- High cost for small projects
- IETF better suited for data interchange formats

=== W3C Recommendation

W3C was considered but:

- W3C focuses on web standards
- ECOSYSTEM.scm is developer tooling, not web-specific
- IETF has precedent for similar formats (GeoJSON, iCalendar)

=== ECMA Standardisation

ECMA was considered but:

- ECMA focuses on programming languages (ECMAScript)
- Data formats typically go through IETF
- Less community familiarity with ECMA process

=== De Facto Standard Only

Operating without formal registration was considered but:

- Media type needed for proper content negotiation
- Formal spec aids interoperability
- Registration provides discoverability
