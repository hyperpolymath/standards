== Planned Development

=== Phase 1: Template Expansion

* [ ] **GOVERNANCE.md template** — Decision-making processes, roles, voting procedures
* [ ] **MAINTAINERS.md template** — Maintainer list format with contact and responsibility areas
* [ ] **CHANGELOG.md template** — Standardized changelog format (Keep a Changelog compliant)
* [ ] **ADR template** — Architecture Decision Records format for technical decisions
* [ ] **RFC template** — Request for Comments process for major proposals

=== Phase 2: Tooling Specifications

* [ ] **justfile standard** — Common task runner commands across projects
* [ ] **flake.nix template** — Standardized Nix flake structure
* [ ] **guix.scm template** — Guix package definition template
* [ ] **deno.json template** — Deno configuration with import maps
* [ ] **.editorconfig** — Consistent editor settings across projects

=== Phase 3: Documentation Standards

* [ ] **API documentation standard** — Required sections, format, examples
* [ ] **README structure guide** — Minimum required sections for project READMEs
* [ ] **Diagram conventions** — Preferred formats (Mermaid, PlantUML, D2)
* [ ] **Versioning policy** — SemVer interpretation and pre-release conventions

=== Phase 4: Security & Compliance

* [ ] **Dependency policy** — Allowed sources, pinning requirements, audit procedures
* [ ] **Cryptography standards** — Approved algorithms, key management practices
* [ ] **SBOM requirements** — Software Bill of Materials generation and format
* [ ] **Signing policy** — Commit signing, release signing, key distribution

=== Phase 5: Ecosystem Integration

* [ ] **Project template repository** — Cookiecutter/copier template for new projects
* [ ] **Compliance checker** — Automated validation of projects against standards
* [ ] **Badge system** — Visual indicators of standards compliance
* [ ] **Migration guides** — Transitioning existing projects to Hyperpolymath standards

== Conceptual Work

=== Palimpsest License Development

The Palimpsest philosophical overlay referenced in `LICENSE.txt` represents ongoing conceptual work on:

* **Consent-based data use** — Framework for explicit permission in digital contexts
* **AI training transparency** — Standards for disclosing training data sources
* **Attribution preservation** — Technical and legal mechanisms for creative lineage
* **Narrative intent protection** — Safeguarding cultural and contextual meaning

See: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/palimpsest-license[palimpsest-license repository]

=== Language Policy Evolution

The language policy may expand to include:

* **WebAssembly guidelines** — WASM compilation targets and toolchains
* **Database preferences** — SQLite, PostgreSQL, SurrealDB recommendations
* **Protocol specifications** — Preferred serialization (MessagePack, Protobuf)
* **Testing frameworks** — Approved testing tools per language

== Contributing to the Roadmap

To propose additions or changes to this roadmap:

1. **Discuss first** — Open a Discussion to gauge interest and gather feedback
2. **Create an Issue** — Document the specific proposal with rationale
3. **Submit a PR** — If approved, update this ROADMAP.adoc and relevant templates

== Non-Goals

This repository does *not* aim to provide:

* Executable code or libraries (standards only)
* Project-specific configurations
* Runtime dependencies
* Opinionated application architectures
