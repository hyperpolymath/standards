== Overview

ANCHOR.scm is the **intervention layer** for the SCM Format Family. It's a "drop
document" that helps projects survive scope storms and get back on track.

When AI agents or projects drift from their intended path, an ANCHOR file provides:

* **Authority Declaration** - Who is issuing the intervention
* **Purpose Statement** - Why realignment is needed
* **Directives** - Specific actions to take
* **SCM Review** - Which SCM files need attention
* **Verification** - How to confirm success

== SCM Format Family

This specification is part of the SCM Format Family:

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
|Format |Repository |Purpose

|META.scm
|https://github.com/hyperpolymath/meta-scm[meta-scm]
|Constitutional authority, architecture decisions

|STATE.scm
|Companion to META
|Project state tracking

|ECOSYSTEM.scm
|Companion to META
|Ecosystem positioning

|PLAYBOOK.scm
|https://github.com/hyperpolymath/playbook-scm[playbook-scm]
|Executable plans derived from META

|AGENTIC.scm

|Operational gating for AI agents

|NEUROSYM.scm
|https://github.com/hyperpolymath/neurosym-scm[neurosym-scm]
|Symbolic semantics, proof obligations

|**ANCHOR.scm**

|**Project recalibration/realignment**

All formats are satellites of https://github.com/hyperpolymath/standards[hyperpolymath/standards].

== When to Use ANCHOR

Use ANCHOR.scm when:

* **Scope Drift** - Project has expanded beyond intended boundaries
* **Direction Change** - Strategic pivot requires explicit realignment
* **Stock-Taking** - Periodic review and verification of alignment
* **Course Correction** - AI agent has accumulated incorrect assumptions

== Quick Start

=== 1. Create the ANCHOR file

Name it `ANCHOR.scm` or `ANCHOR-[purpose]-[date].scm`.

=== 2. Define Authority

[source,scheme]
----
(define authority
  '((superintendent
     (name . "Project Owner")
     (role . "owner"))
    (issued
     (date . "2026-01-03"))))
----

=== 3. State Purpose

[source,scheme]
----
(define purpose
  '((type . "scope-arrest")
    (summary . "Halt scope expansion and stabilize")))
----

=== 4. Add Directives

[source,scheme]
----
(define directives
  '((immediate
     ((action . "halt-new-features")
      (priority . "critical")))))
----

=== 5. Drop into Repository

Place in root or `.machine_readable/` directory.

=== 6. Instruct AI

Tell the AI: "Go to the ANCHOR.scm file first."

See `examples/` for complete examples.

== Execution Pipeline Position

ANCHOR operates at the **intervention tier** - above normal execution:

[source]
----
INTERVENTION LAYER:
  ANCHOR.scm     ← Recalibration directives

EXECUTION PIPELINE:
  1. META validation
  2. AGENTIC gating
  3. NEUROSYM semantics
  4. PLAYBOOK derivation
  5. Execution
  6. ECOSYSTEM check
  7. STATE update
----

ANCHOR can override or reset any level of the execution pipeline.

== Specification

The complete normative specification is in link:spec/ANCHOR-FORMAT-SPEC.adoc[spec/ANCHOR-FORMAT-SPEC.adoc].
