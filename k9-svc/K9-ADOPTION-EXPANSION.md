- **Smallest:** rsr-compliance-checklist.k9.ncl (180 lines)

## Key Innovations

### 1. Ultimate Dogfooding (k9-svc/release-k9.k9.ncl)
K9-SVC releases itself using a K9 component, creating a trust chain:
```
K9 component → k9-sign (built by K9) → K9 release artifacts
```

### 2. Multi-Tier Automation (echidna/setup-prover-env.k9.ncl)
Progressive capability deployment:
- Tier 1: 6 provers (Agda, Coq, Lean, Isabelle, Z3, CVC5)
- Tier 2: 3 provers (Metamath, HOL Light, Mizar)
- Tier 3: 2 provers (PVS, ACL2)
- Tier 4: 1 prover (HOL4)

### 3. Neurosymbolic Integration (hypatia/deploy-security-scan.k9.ncl)
Learning system feedback loop:
- Neural pattern recognition
- Symbolic rule distillation
- Automatic rule improvement via telemetry

### 4. Bot Orchestration (gitbot-fleet/deploy-bot-fleet.k9.ncl)
Coordinated 6-bot fleet with shared context layer and priority-based execution.

## Impact

### Security Hardening
- Hypatia security scanning deployed across organization
- Automated compliance checking (RSR standards)
- Safe release automation with cryptographic signatures

### Developer Experience
- One-command dev environment setup
- Automated prover installation (saves hours)
- Release process reduced from manual to automated

### Standards Enforcement
- RSR compliance as code
- Bot fleet quality gates
- Configuration validation before deployment

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
1. **robot-repo-automaton** ← Uses RSR compliance checklist
2. **hypatia** ← Feeds findings to robot-repo-automaton
3. **gitbot-fleet** ← Coordinates with hypatia and robot-repo-automaton
4. **k9-sign** ← Used by k9-svc release automation

### With Future Systems
1. **Nickel-based configs** can import these K9 components
2. **MCP servers** can use poly-git-mcp schema
3. **Theorem provers** auto-installed via echidna component
4. **CI/CD systems** can invoke K9 components directly

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Just recipes** provide clean task orchestration
2. **Nickel contracts** catch configuration errors before execution
3. **Security levels** give users appropriate control
4. **Dogfooding** validates K9's own design

### Challenges Addressed
1. **Complex dependencies** handled via recipe ordering
2. **Environment variation** managed via detection + preference
3. **Security concerns** addressed with dry-run modes
4. **Version compatibility** handled via SHA-pinning

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Task #2 Complete:** 10 repos with K9 components
2. **Task #3:** Create additional K9 tooling and templates
3. **Task #4:** K9 performance benchmarks
4. **Community Adoption:** Share K9 components as examples

## Conclusion

K9 adoption has expanded from **1 repo (k9-svc)** to **10 repos** spanning infrastructure, development tools, standards, and simulation. The components demonstrate K9's flexibility across all three security levels (Kennel, Yard, Hunt) and show real-world use cases from simple config validation to complex release automation.

**Most importantly:** K9 now "eats its own dog food" by releasing itself using a K9 component, validating the core philosophy that **a format should be able to validate and deploy itself**.
