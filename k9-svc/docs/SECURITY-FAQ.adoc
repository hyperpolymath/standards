== Part I: The Big Questions

=== Q1: Is K9 secure?

**Short Answer:** Not yet, but it can be.

**Longer Answer:**

K9's security **design** is sound:
- Three-tier leash system (Kennel/Yard/Hunt)
- Ed25519 signature requirement for Hunt level
- Manual trust establishment
- Functional purity at Yard level

K9's **implementation** has gaps:
- sign.sh is a shell script (vulnerable to injection)
- No sandboxing options
- No static analysis tools
- Key management is manual

**After full implementation** (Tier 1-3 in roadmap):
- 95% risk elimination
- Security comparable to Docker (signed images), Ansible (signed playbooks)
- Suitable for professional/enterprise use

**Timeline to "secure":**
- Tier 1 (70% risk elimination): 3-5 weeks
- Tier 2 (90% risk elimination): 2-3 months
- Tier 3 (95% risk elimination): 6-12 months

---

=== Q2: Isn't "self-executing config" just malware?

**This is the perception problem.**

**Yes, it sounds scary.** Historically, "active documents" = malware:
- Microsoft Office macros
- Adobe PDF exploits
- ActiveX controls

**But K9 is different:**

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
| Malware Pattern | K9 Design | Key Difference

| **Auto-executes**
| Requires signature verification
| Hunt level won't run without trusted key

| **Hidden payload**
| Just recipes are visible
| User can review before first run

| **No user control**
| Three security levels
| Kennel (safe), Yard (sandboxed), Hunt (privileged)

| **Social engineering**
| Manual trust establishment
| User must explicitly trust signing keys
|===

**Similar "scary" technologies that succeeded:**
- **PowerShell**: Initially feared, now industry standard (with signing)
- **Docker**: "Random code from internet in containers" → accepted (with signing)
- **Snap/Flatpak**: Apps execute code → trusted (with sandboxing)

**K9 follows the same pattern:** Powerful capability + security model + clear use cases = accepted tool.

**The terminology problem:**
- "Self-executing" → sounds like virus
- "Unleash" → sounds like attack
- "Hunt" → sounds predatory

**Solution:** Rename problematic terms (in progress):
- "Self-executing" → "Self-validating with optional deployment"
- "Unleash" → "Deploy"
- "Hunt" → "Production"

---

=== Q3: What if someone steals my signing key?

**This is a real risk.**

**Current state (v1.0.0):**
- Keys stored in `~/.config/k9/keys/` with 600 permissions
- No password protection
- No revocation mechanism
- If stolen: attacker can sign malicious K9 files

**After Tier 1 (week 1-5):**
- Password-protected keys (optional but recommended)
- Warning prompts before trusting keys
- Key fingerprint display

**After Tier 2 (month 1-3):**
- **HSM/YubiKey required for production keys** ← SOLVES software theft
- Key revocation system (CRL or similar)
- Key rotation documentation

**Best practices (now):**
1. Generate separate keys for dev/prod
2. Store prod keys on separate machine (air-gapped signing)
3. Use strong file permissions (600)
4. Regularly rotate keys
5. Monitor for unexpected signatures

**Best practices (after Tier 2):**
1. **Production keys MUST be on HSM/YubiKey**
2. Dev keys can use password protection
3. Rotate keys annually
4. Publish key fingerprints on official website
5. Use key revocation for compromised keys

**If key is compromised:**
1. Immediately revoke key (add to CRL)
2. Notify all users (security advisory)
3. Generate new key
4. Re-sign all legitimate K9 files
5. Investigate how compromise occurred

---

=== Q4: Can K9 be used to deliver malware?

**Yes, like any powerful tool.**

**The honest answer:**
- K9 at Hunt level has full system access
- If attacker has a trusted signing key, they can deliver malware
- If user trusts wrong key, they can be infected

**This is the same for:**
- PowerShell scripts (if signed with trusted cert)
- Docker images (if from trusted registry)
- Ansible playbooks (if signed with trusted key)
- Bash scripts (if from trusted source)

**K9's defenses:**

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Defense Layer | How It Helps | Effectiveness

| **Signature requirement**
| Malware must be signed by trusted key
| 🟢 HIGH (if key management good)

| **Manual trust**
| User must explicitly trust attacker's key
| 🟡 MEDIUM (social engineering possible)

| **Static analysis** (k9-scan)
| Flags dangerous commands
| 🟡 MEDIUM (can be bypassed)

| **Dry-run mode**
| Shows commands before execution
| 🟡 MEDIUM (users can ignore)

| **Sandbox** (Tier 2)
| Contains damage if malware runs
| 🟢 HIGH (limits blast radius)
|===

**The reality:**
- K9 is a tool, tools can be abused
- Security depends on key management and user awareness
- After Tier 2, comparable to industry-standard tools

**Mitigation strategy:**
1. Only trust keys from verified sources (official repo, personal verification)
2. Review Just recipes before first run (especially Hunt level)
3. Use k9-scan to check for malicious patterns
4. Run in sandbox for initial testing
5. Limit Hunt level to trusted, production configs

---

=== Q5: Will antivirus software flag K9 files?

**Probably yes, initially.**

**Why:**
- K9 files contain executable code (Just recipes)
- Hunt-level components have full system access
- Signature system can look like code signing malware uses
- "Self-executing config" matches malware patterns

**Historical precedent:**
- PowerShell scripts often flagged
- Docker images with crypto miners flagged
- Legitimate admin tools flagged (Sysinternals, etc.)

**Mitigation:**

**Short-term (Tier 1):**
1. Submit K9 tooling for code signing (Authenticode on Windows, etc.)
2. Report false positives to AV vendors
3. Document whitelist procedure for enterprise IT
4. Add `k9` to NIST National Vulnerability Database (clarify it's not malware)

**Long-term (Tier 2-3):**
1. Security audit by reputable firm (Trail of Bits, NCC Group)
2. Publish audit results
3. Industry acceptance (conference talks, papers)
4. Enterprise adoption (credibility)

**If your AV flags K9:**
1. Check signature (ensure it's legitimate K9, not malware)
2. Submit false positive report to AV vendor
3. Whitelist K9 tooling (must, justfile, sign.sh)
4. Use VirusTotal to verify (should be clean except heuristic flags)

**For enterprise deployment:**
- Include K9 whitelist in security policy
- Document security assessment
- Require Hunt-level components to be reviewed by security team
- Monitor for abuse

---

=== Q6: What happens if Nickel has a vulnerability?

**This is a supply chain risk.**

**Nickel is an external dependency:**
- Written in Rust (memory-safe, good)
- Actively maintained (good)
- Used for evaluation at Yard and Hunt levels (critical)
- If Nickel has bug, K9 inherits it (bad)

**Potential Nickel vulnerabilities:**

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Vulnerability Type | Impact on K9 | Mitigation

| **Memory corruption**
| Low (Nickel is Rust)
| Nickel already memory-safe

| **Infinite loop / DoS**
| Hang K9 validation
| Timeout + memory limits

| **Type confusion**
| Break contract guarantees
| Keep Nickel updated

| **Sandbox escape**
| Yard-level code executes with I/O
| Sandbox Nickel process
|===

**Current mitigation (v1.0.0):**
- Functional purity (Yard level has no I/O)
- Contract isolation (limits blast radius)
- Dependency pinning (known good version)

**After Tier 2:**
- **Nickel runs in isolated process with seccomp filter**
  - No network access
  - No file I/O (except stdin/stdout)
  - Memory limit enforced by kernel
  - Timeout enforced by parent process
- Result: Even if Nickel exploited, contained

**If Nickel CVE published:**
1. Assess impact on K9 (does it affect our usage?)
2. Update Nickel immediately
3. Release K9 patch version
4. Notify users (security advisory)
5. Add test case for vulnerability

**Vendor Nickel?**
- Pro: Eliminates external supply chain
- Con: Miss Nickel security updates
- **Recommendation:** Don't vendor, but sandbox process

---

=== Q7: Should I use K9 for production systems?

**It depends on which tier you need.**

**NOT YET (current v1.0.0):**
- sign.sh is shell script (vulnerable)
- No sandboxing
- Key management manual
- **Use for:** Research, prototypes, internal experimentation

**MAYBE (after Tier 1, weeks 1-5):**
- sign.sh rewritten in Rust (memory-safe)
- Refuses to run as root
- Improved key management
- **Use for:** Internal production (with documented risks)

**YES (after Tier 2, months 1-3):**
- HSM-backed keys
- Nickel sandboxed
- Reproducible builds
- **Use for:** External-facing production, enterprise deployment

**DEFINITELY (after Tier 3, months 6-12):**
- Formal verification
- Security audit complete
- Bug bounty program
- **Use for:** Mission-critical, regulated environments

**Decision matrix:**

[cols="2,1,1,1"]
|===
| Use Case | Current | After Tier 1 | After Tier 2

| **Research/prototype**
| ✅ YES
| ✅ YES
| ✅ YES

| **Internal dev tools**
| 🟡 MAYBE
| ✅ YES
| ✅ YES

| **Internal production**
| ❌ NO
| 🟡 MAYBE
| ✅ YES

| **External production**
| ❌ NO
| ❌ NO
| ✅ YES

| **Mission-critical**
| ❌ NO
| ❌ NO
| 🟡 MAYBE (Tier 3)

| **Regulated (HIPAA, PCI)**
| ❌ NO
| ❌ NO
| 🟡 MAYBE (Tier 3 + audit)
|===

== Part II: Technical Deep Dives

=== Q8: How does K9 signature verification work?

**High-level flow:**

```
1. User generates Ed25519 keypair:
   ./sign.sh keygen production

2. Sign K9 file:
   ./sign.sh sign config.k9.ncl production
   → Creates config.k9.ncl.sig

3. Distribute public key (production.pub) to users

4. User trusts public key:
   ./sign.sh trust production.pub
   → Copies to ~/.config/k9/keys/trusted/

5. Verify signature:
   ./sign.sh verify config.k9.ncl
   → Checks signature against all trusted keys
   → Only runs if signature valid
```

**Current implementation (sign.sh):**

```bash
# Simplified verification logic
verified=false
for pubkey in ~/.config/k9/keys/trusted/*.pub; do
    if openssl pkeyutl -verify \
        -pubin -inkey "$pubkey" \
        -rawin -in "$file" \
        -sigfile "$sigfile" 2>/dev/null; then
        verified=true
        break
    fi
done

if [ "$verified" = "false" ]; then
    echo "INVALID SIGNATURE"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Weaknesses:**
- Shell script (injection risk)
- Error handling (2>/dev/null hides issues)
- No timeout (malformed sig could hang)
- TOCTOU race (time-of-check to time-of-use)

**After Tier 1 (Rust rewrite):**

```rust
// Pseudo-code for Rust implementation
use ed25519_dalek::{PublicKey, Signature, Verifier};

fn verify_signature(file: &Path, sig_file: &Path) -> Result<String> {
    // Read file content
    let content = fs::read(file)?;
    let sig_bytes = fs::read(sig_file)?;
    let signature = Signature::from_bytes(&sig_bytes)?;

    // Try each trusted key
    let trusted_keys = load_trusted_keys()?;
    for (name, pubkey) in trusted_keys {
        if pubkey.verify(&content, &signature).is_ok() {
            return Ok(name); // Signature valid, return key name
        }
    }

    Err("No trusted key verified signature")
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Memory-safe (no buffer overflows)
- Proper error handling
- Timeout on verification
- Atomic verify-then-execute

---

=== Q9: What are the security levels (Kennel/Yard/Hunt)?

**Three-tier leash system:**

==== Kennel Level: Pure Data

```nickel
K9!
leash = 'Kennel  # Data only, no execution

pedigree = {
  schema_version = "1.0.0",
  component_type = "static-content"
}

# Just data, no code
config = {
  title = "My Document",
  author = "Alice",
  content = "Lorem ipsum..."
}
```

**Permissions:**
- ✅ Read data
- ❌ No Nickel evaluation
- ❌ No Just recipes
- ❌ No I/O

**Use cases:**
- Documentation
- Static content
- Untrusted sources
- Embedded data

**Security:** 🟢 **SAFE** - Can open from untrusted sources

---

==== Yard Level: Sandboxed Evaluation

```nickel
K9!
leash = 'Yard  # Validation only, no I/O

pedigree = {
  schema_version = "1.0.0",
  component_type = "config-validator"
}

# Nickel evaluation permitted
config = {
  port | Number = 8080,
  host | String = "0.0.0.0",

  # Contract validation runs
  port
    | std.number.Positive
    | std.contract.from_predicate (fun p => p >= 1024 && p <= 65535)
}
```

**Permissions:**
- ✅ Read data
- ✅ Nickel evaluation (functional, pure)
- ❌ No Just recipes
- ❌ No I/O (file system, network)

**Use cases:**
- Configuration validation
- Schema checking
- Contract enforcement
- Build-time validation

**Security:** 🟡 **MOSTLY SAFE** - Nickel bugs could cause DoS, but no I/O access

---

==== Hunt Level: Full Execution

```nickel
K9!
leash = 'Hunt  # Full execution, requires signature

pedigree = {
  schema_version = "1.0.0",
  component_type = "production-deployment",
  signature = "base64encodedSignature..."  # Required!
}

config = {
  deploy_target = "production",
  # ... config ...
}
```

**Permissions:**
- ✅ Read data
- ✅ Nickel evaluation
- ✅ Just recipes execute
- ✅ Full I/O (file system, network, processes)

**Requirements:**
- 🔐 **MUST be cryptographically signed**
- 🔐 **Signature must be from trusted key**
- 🔐 **User must explicitly authorize**

**Use cases:**
- Production deployments
- System configuration
- Infrastructure as Code
- CI/CD pipelines

**Security:** 🔴 **DANGEROUS** - Full system access, only use with trusted, signed configs

---

=== Q10: Can I audit what a K9 file will do before running it?

**Yes, multiple ways:**

==== 1. Read the Just Recipes

K9 files include `justfile` with deployment recipes:

```bash
# Read the justfile to see what will execute
cat justfile

# Look for dangerous commands
grep -E "rm -rf|curl.*bash|eval|exec" justfile
```

**What to look for:**
- `rm -rf` (file deletion)
- `curl ... | bash` (remote code execution)
- `eval` / `exec` (code injection risk)
- Network access (`curl`, `wget`, `nc`)
- Privilege escalation (`sudo`, `su`)

==== 2. Use k9-scan (After Tier 1)

```bash
k9-scan suspicious.k9.ncl

# Output:
# ⚠️  RISK LEVEL: HIGH
#
# Dangerous patterns found:
# - Line 42: rm -rf /tmp/* (file deletion)
# - Line 58: curl https://unknown.com/script.sh | bash (remote execution)
# - Line 73: sudo systemctl restart (privilege escalation)
#
# Recommendation: DO NOT RUN without review
```

==== 3. Dry-Run Mode (After Tier 1)

```bash
./must deploy --dry-run

# Output:
# Would execute:
#   1. mkdir -p /opt/app
#   2. cp config.json /opt/app/
#   3. systemctl restart app.service
#
# Proceed? [y/N]
```

==== 4. Run in Sandbox (After Tier 2)

```bash
k9-sandbox --container suspicious.k9.ncl

# Runs in isolated Podman container:
# - No access to host filesystem
# - No network access
# - Limited memory/CPU
# - Can observe behavior safely
```

==== 5. Static Analysis

```bash
# Check for network activity
grep -r "curl\|wget\|nc\|ssh" .

# Check for file operations
grep -r "rm\|mv\|cp\|dd" .

# Check for privilege escalation
grep -r "sudo\|su\|setuid\|chmod" .

# Check signature
./sign.sh verify config.k9.ncl
```

**Best practice:**
1. Read justfile first
2. Run k9-scan
3. Dry-run to see actual commands
4. Verify signature
5. If still unsure, run in sandbox first

---

== Part III: Practical Guidance

=== Q11: How do I use K9 safely RIGHT NOW (v1.0.0)?

**Conservative approach (safest):**

1. **Use Kennel/Yard only:**
```bash
# Validation only, no execution
nickel eval config.k9.ncl
```

2. **Never use Hunt level** until Tier 1 complete

3. **If you must use Hunt:**
   - Only on isolated VM/container
   - Only with files you wrote yourself
   - Manually review justfile before running
   - Never with files from internet

**Moderate approach (documented risks):**

1. **Generate your own keys:**
```bash
./sign.sh keygen mykey
chmod 600 ~/.config/k9/keys/mykey.key
```

2. **Sign your own K9 files:**
```bash
./sign.sh sign myconfig.k9.ncl mykey
```

3. **Trust only your own key:**
```bash
./sign.sh trust ~/.config/k9/keys/mykey.pub
```

4. **Never trust external keys** (even from collaborators, until Tier 2)

5. **Review before first run:**
```bash
# Read the entire K9 file
cat myconfig.k9.ncl

# Read the justfile
cat justfile

# Manually verify no malicious commands
```

**Aggressive approach (for experts only):**

1. Audit sign.sh source code yourself
2. Run K9 in dedicated VM (disposable)
3. Monitor with system call tracing:
```bash
strace -f ./must deploy 2>&1 | tee execution.log
```
4. Network isolation (air-gapped or firewall)
5. Backup before execution

**NOT recommended (unsafe):**
- ❌ Trusting keys from random internet sources
- ❌ Running unsigned Hunt-level files
- ❌ Running as root
- ❌ Running K9 files from email attachments
- ❌ Auto-executing K9 files without review

---

=== Q12: What should I tell my security team?

**Talking points for CISOs/security teams:**

==== Honest Assessment

**Current State (v1.0.0):**
- "K9 is a research prototype with known security gaps"
- "Not recommended for production without additional hardening"
- "Similar to running shell scripts from trusted sources"
- "Requires security-aware users and proper key management"

**After Tier 1 (weeks 1-5):**
- "K9 has memory-safe implementation (Rust)"
- "Comparable to signed PowerShell scripts or Ansible playbooks"
- "Suitable for internal use with documented risks"
- "Requires key management policy"

**After Tier 2 (months 1-3):**
- "K9 has hardware-backed keys and sandboxing"
- "Security comparable to Docker (signed images) or Snap/Flatpak"
- "Suitable for production deployment"
- "Recommend security audit before mission-critical use"

==== Risk Comparison

== Part IV: Future Vision

=== Q14: What's the long-term security vision for K9?

**Short-term (2026 Q1-Q2):**
- ✅ Tier 1-2 implementation complete
- ✅ Security audit by reputable firm
- ✅ Bug bounty program launched
- ✅ Industry-standard security

**Medium-term (2026 Q3-Q4):**

- ✅ NIST/FIPS compliance (if needed)

**Long-term (2027+):**
- ✅ Industry-leading security
- ✅ Zero critical vulnerabilities (goal)
- ✅ Academic research (security conferences)
- ✅ Standardization (IETF RFC?)

**Security will always be priority #1** for K9.

---

=== Q15: Will K9 always have security risks?

**Honest answer: Yes, but manageable.**

**Irreducible risks (cannot eliminate):**
1. **Human error** - Users will trust wrong keys, ignore warnings
2. **Zero-day vulnerabilities** - Unknown bugs in dependencies
3. **Hunt inherent risk** - Full system access is the feature
4. **Physical security** - Attacker with hardware access can steal keys (even HSM)
5. **Social engineering** - Users can be tricked

**These risks exist for ALL powerful tools:**
- PowerShell has same risks
- Docker has same risks
- Ansible has same risks
- Even sandboxed tools (Snap) have risks

**The goal is NOT "perfect security" (impossible).**

**The goal is "industry-standard security" (achievable):**
- Comparable to established tools
- Transparent about limitations
- Continuous improvement
- Responsible disclosure

**After full implementation:**
- 95% risk elimination (technical)
- 5% irreducible (human/design)
- This is acceptable for industry use

**We will never claim K9 is "100% secure."**

**We will always:**
- Document known risks honestly
- Fix vulnerabilities promptly
- Improve continuously
- Engage with security community

---

== Conclusion
