== Executive Summary

**What:** K9-SVC is a self-validating configuration format with cryptographic signatures

**Why:** Prevents misconfiguration in multi-platform deployments (Linux, Minix, embedded systems)

**Security Status:** Research prototype → Production-ready in 2-3 months

**Investment:** $50-150k for security hardening

**Decision:** Use internally now (with mitigations), wait 2-3 months for external deployment

---

== 3-Minute Briefing

=== What is K9-SVC?

**Elevator pitch:**
> Configuration files that validate themselves and refuse to run if invalid. Think "Docker for configs" - signed, versioned, validated.

**Technical:**
- Configuration format using Nickel (typed config language)
- Three security levels: Kennel (data), Yard (validation), Production (execution)
- Ed25519 cryptographic signatures for production deployments
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Minix, embedded systems)

**Use cases:**
- Multi-architecture deployments
- Infrastructure as Code (alternative to Ansible/Terraform for specific scenarios)
- Self-validating documentation
- Embedded systems configuration

---

=== Security Concerns

**Two main concerns raised:**

**1. Actual Security Risks:**
- Configuration files that execute code (like PowerShell, Docker)
- Requires careful key management
- Current implementation has gaps (shell script, no sandbox)

**2. Perception Risks:**
- "Self-executing configs" historically associated with malware
- Security community may flag as dangerous
- Antivirus may detect as threat

**Both concerns are valid and being addressed.**

=== Risk Assessment

[cols="2,1,1,1"]
|===
| Risk Category | Current (v1.0.0) | After Hardening | Industry Standard

| **Malware delivery**
| 🔴 MEDIUM-HIGH
| 🟢 LOW
| Docker: 🟢 LOW

| **Key compromise**
| 🔴 HIGH
| 🟢 LOW
| Code signing: 🟢 LOW

| **Code injection**
| 🔴 HIGH
| 🟢 VERY LOW
| PowerShell: 🟡 MEDIUM

| **Supply chain**
| 🔴 HIGH
| 🟡 MEDIUM
| Kubernetes: 🟡 MEDIUM

| **Privilege escalation**
| 🟡 MEDIUM
| 🟢 VERY LOW
| Ansible: 🟢 LOW
|===

**Verdict:** After hardening, security comparable to established tools (Docker, PowerShell, Ansible).

---

== Decision Framework

=== Should we adopt K9-SVC?

**Answer these questions:**

1. **Do we deploy to multiple architectures?** (Linux, embedded, edge)
   - If YES → K9 is useful
   - If NO → Ansible/Terraform may suffice

2. **Do we need formal validation of configs?** (contracts, proofs)
   - If YES → K9 provides value
   - If NO → YAML configs may suffice

3. **Can we wait 2-3 months for production-ready version?**
   - If YES → Plan adoption for Q2 2026
   - If NO → Use alternatives now, revisit later

4. **Do we have budget for security hardening?** ($50-150k)
   - If YES → Contribute to development
   - If NO → Wait for community implementation

5. **Internal or external use?**
   - Internal only → Can adopt after Tier 1 (weeks 3-5)
   - External/customer-facing → Wait for Tier 2 (months 2-3)

---

=== Adoption Timeline

**Now (January 2026):**
- ❌ **Do not use** for production
- ✅ **Can use** for research, prototypes, internal experimentation
- ✅ **Can evaluate** for future adoption

**March 2026 (Tier 1 complete):**
- ✅ **Can use** for internal professional use (documented risks)
- 🟡 **Maybe** for low-risk production (with mitigations)
- ❌ **Do not use** for external/customer-facing

**April-May 2026 (Tier 2 complete):**
- ✅ **Can use** for all production environments
- ✅ **Can use** for external/customer-facing (with security review)
- ✅ **Can promote** externally

**Q3-Q4 2026 (Tier 3 complete):**
- ✅ **Industry-leading security**
- ✅ **Suitable for mission-critical**
- ✅ **Suitable for regulated environments** (with certifications)

**For routing to decision makers:**

```
TO: [CISO, CTO, VP Engineering]
FROM: [Your name]
DATE: 2026-01-30
RE: K9-SVC Adoption Decision

RECOMMENDATION: [Adopt / Wait / Decline]

SUMMARY:
K9-SVC is a self-validating configuration format that could reduce
our config-related outages and provide formal validation guarantees.

CURRENT STATUS:
- Research prototype (v1.0.0)
- Known security gaps (documented)
- Security hardening in progress (2-3 months to production-ready)

SECURITY ASSESSMENT:
- Current: NOT recommended for production
- After Tier 1 (March 2026): Internal use acceptable
- After Tier 2 (May 2026): Production-ready
- Security audit planned Q1 2026

INVESTMENT REQUIRED:
- Dev time: [X hours over Y months]
- Budget: $[50-150k depending on tier]
- Resources: [2-3 developers, 1 security specialist]

RISKS:
- Security vulnerabilities (mitigated by Tier 1-2 implementation)
- Immaturity (addressed by conservative rollout)
- Perception issues (addressed by proactive communication)

BENEFITS:
- Formal validation (prevent config errors)
- Multi-platform support (Linux, embedded, Minix)
- Self-validating configs (fail-fast)
- Open source (no vendor lock-in)

PROPOSED PILOT:
- System: [Internal dev tools / Non-critical services]
- Timeline: [Q2 2026]
- Success criteria: [Reduced config errors, deployment time]

NEXT STEPS:
1. Approve/decline proposal
2. If approved: Allocate resources
3. If declined: Revisit in [Q3 2026] after security hardening

== Talking Points

=== For Security Team

"K9 is like PowerShell or Docker - powerful but requires proper security controls. Current implementation has gaps we're addressing through Rust rewrite, HSM integration, and security audit. After hardening, security will be comparable to industry standards."

=== For Engineering Team

"K9 provides compile-time validation of configs using Nickel's type system. Invalid configs refuse to run. It's like having Rust's type safety for infrastructure code. We're hardening security now, production-ready in 2-3 months."

=== For Executives

"K9 reduces config-related outages through formal validation. It's early-stage, so we'll pilot internally first, wait for security hardening, then expand if successful. Investment: $50-150k over 6-12 months."

=== For Customers (External)

"We use K9 for configuration management because it provides formal guarantees that our infrastructure is configured correctly. It's undergone professional security audit [after Tier 2], and we follow industry best practices for key management."

---

== Red Flags (Don't Adopt If...)

❌ **Need production-ready NOW** → Wait 2-3 months

❌ **Cannot tolerate any security risk** → Wait for Tier 3 + audit

❌ **No in-house technical expertise** → Wait for managed service

❌ **Regulated industry** → Wait for certifications (if required)

❌ **No budget for security** → Wait for community implementation

❌ **Need mature ecosystem** → Ansible/Terraform better choice

❌ **Standard platforms only** → K9's multi-platform value not needed

---

== Green Lights (Good Fit If...)

✅ **Multi-architecture deployments** (K9's strength)

✅ **Need formal validation** (Nickel contracts)

✅ **Technical team available** (can contribute to development)

✅ **Can start internal-only** (wait for production hardening)

✅ **Budget for security** (worthwhile investment)

✅ **Academic/research context** (formal methods interest)

✅ **Open source friendly** (can contribute back)

---

== Due Diligence Checklist

=== Before Approval

**Technical:**
- [ ] Review source code (https://github.com/hyperpolymath/k9-svc)
- [ ] Test in isolated environment
- [ ] Verify dependencies (Nickel, Just, OpenSSL)
- [ ] Assess operational complexity

**Security:**
- [ ] Read complete threat model (SECURITY-ANALYSIS.adoc)
- [ ] Identify unacceptable risks

**Legal:**
- [ ] Review license (PMPL-1.0-or-later)
- [ ] Assess open source risks
- [ ] Export control (cryptography)
- [ ] IP ownership (clear for open source)

**Operational:**
- [ ] Training requirements (team needs Nickel/Just knowledge)
- [ ] Support availability (community-based currently)
- [ ] Migration path (from existing tools)
- [ ] Exit strategy (if K9 doesn't work out)

**Financial:**
- [ ] Total cost of ownership (development, security, maintenance)
- [ ] ROI calculation (vs config-related outages)
- [ ] Budget approval
- [ ] Resource allocation

---

== Conclusion

**K9-SVC is promising but immature.**

**Security concerns are real and being addressed comprehensively.**

**Timeline to production-ready: 2-3 months**

**Investment required: $50-150k depending on security tier**

**Recommendation for most organizations:**
> Evaluate now, pilot Q2 2026 (after Tier 1), production Q3 2026 (after Tier 2).

**Exception (can adopt earlier):**
- Academic/research (now)
- Internal dev tools (after Tier 1)

**Exception (should wait longer):**
- Mission-critical systems (wait for Tier 3)
- Regulated industries (wait for certifications)
